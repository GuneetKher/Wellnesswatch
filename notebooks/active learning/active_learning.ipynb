      "{'serious': {'Post 1': {'Title': 'oh boy. please help.', 'Text': 'TW: Mentions of CSA, descriptions of child abuse just overall toxic shit\\n\\nI (28F) already wasn\\'t doing great. My parents divorced when I was three, and I was sexually assaulted by family as a very small child (4-8), then abused by my sister who is ten years older whenever she babysat for our single mother (who divorced my father after years of abuse towards her and my older sister, but in particular after one incident in which our dad beat my sister so bad she lost control of her bowels). I was also abused financially by my dad and on a few occasions physically by my mother (and I don\\'t mean like discipline). I also watched my mom and sister sit on top of (they were not small women) my nieces and pour hot sauce down their mouths, hold their noses closed, while the girls (3-11) were wearing long sleeves and pants. \\n\\nTwo years ago, one of my pedophile uncles died. I guess this prompted my sister to begin talking about sexual abuse she received as well. From the person who overheard my sister\\'s call, it sounded like two different uncles were known abusers, including the one who assaulted me. \\n\\nI started seeing red, because I had been sexually assaulted by an adult family friend when I was in middle school (12?), and at that time my sister and mother were having a hushed conversation about someone being assaulted. I felt hurt, in part because my sister told our mother immediately instead of giving me a chance to figure out how to say what happened. I felt like she hijacked my assault. None of the adults listened to even the details of what happened before they started screaming and going for the guy (who lived next door). Now I felt like more conversations were being had about what happened to me that I wasn\\'t part of, and I honestly could have used the conversations because no one even asked me if I was okay. My uncle (one of the pedos) who owned the property (a trailer park) kicked the guy out, but we didn\\'t call the police. My mom and sister told me that my sister had been assaulted by someone in the family when I asked what they were talking about, but wouldn\\'t tell me who. The mistrust made it impossible to bring up my own experiences with family members in that instance, but if I had, I would have learned who to stay away from. They denied me that. \\n\\nAnyway this all put me in the hotheaded space to pounce (but in a private text message, which I wrote on my own and did not share) when my sister began slamming my dad on Facebook just days after finding out about the eavesdropped-on conversation my sister was having saying that he wasn\\'t her dad, that some guy who isn\\'t even related to us that she barely saw was her dad etc. This is sort of normal for my sister to go 100% in on someone. I said she wasn\\'t a great mother either because she let the same uncles babysit her kids and be around me (she likes to say that she raised me instead of admitting she abused and borderline physically tortured me because our mom couldn\\'t afford child care) even though they assaulted her. She started telling multiple family members (who all think I\\'m crazy because I tried to commit suicide and had to be admitted to the ICU three weeks after my mother died when I was 19 and with an abusive partner who had recently punched me in the skull so hard my entire head was black and purple; he also attacked me the day we buried my mother) she was on her way to shoot me with her handgun. The drive is 12 hours. Her 16 year old daughter (at the time) called me sobbing and screaming from her job at pizza hut that her mom was on her way to kill me. She had to ask to be calmed down by the trailer park pedo king and another couple of family members, but she even told the police she was making the drive with the gun.... Nothing was done, she turned around and told everyone she just wanted to scare me. No one stopped talking to her, but she forced my nieces (who I grew up with sort of as sisters) to go NC with me and our father, told everyone we were drug addicts etc. \\n\\nAfter this, I start thinking about where I can find external proof that more of my traumatic memories were real. After getting some corroboration via Reddit, I confronted my dad, who co-owns the land both our houses were on. I asked if he knew, he admitted he knew most things but not that I had been assaulted. My sister is nearly ten years older than me. If they had told the police, my trauma may not have occurred.... So I asked why they never told the police/why no one ever went to jail. He got hostile and defensive. We didn\\'t speak for over two weeks (completely out of character because we shared a mailbox, driveway, yards, etc.). When we eventually did, he would randomly pepper in that I shouldn\\'t keep trying to find every little detail out about what happened.... But I never brought it up, he would be the one. \\n\\nI asked my mom\\'s sister (who I was estranged from) if she knew about any of this, and she said no but that she believed me because the same things happened to her from HER BROTHER, the same trailer park pedo. She is like ten years older than my sister.... If she had said something, maybe neither me or my sister would have been hurt. \\n\\nA month or two later, my dad sees my husband (36) and I moving a chair out of the house that my dad (who owns a POS thrift store) had offered to me. We told him it didn\\'t fit through the doors because it didn\\'t. He barged through the entry to the house talking about taking our doorframes off, and he also picked up the chair while his hands were covered in BLACK grease. I asked if he would please take the chair back outside now that he tried forcing it through two doors and seeing it didn\\'t fit, and also now that he had ruined the light-colored chair by picking it up with dirty hands. He lost his mind. He started yelling and shaking his fingers in my face, and he told me I was \"asking for it\" with my attitude. I asked my dad \"how would you like to be asked to leave?\" My husband was standing kind of behind me, but the situation cooled down quickly when my dad walked out, so he did nothing. \\n\\nMy niece called to let me know she and her sister are being abused my my sister. She also tells me that trailer park pedo uncle\\'s some tried to have sex with her when she was around 11 and he was around 25 maybe? I called the FBI and the local agency because I am not in the same state. I also contacted child services to report my sister. \\n\\nFew months later my husband and I just get in the door. It\\'s dark out. I lock the door as soon as we get in because we recently had to put our massive German shepherd down, and I have lasting fear of my abusers showing up to kill me. Not even five minutes after we get in, we hear my dad outside yelling on the front deck, screaming for me to stop something. Husband and I are confused, we have no idea what\\'s happening. My dad starts kicking the door and then shouldering the door in until the frame breaks. He immediately grabs me, throws me around, hits me gets on top of me, strangles me, all while telling my husband (frozen in the corner behind the busted door) to leave. I managed to yell for my echo dot to call 911, and even though she can\\'t do that, it was enough to get my dad off.  We tried to both drive our cars away but my dad blocked my car. I had to run and find a phone to call my husband to come back and get me because dad blocked the driveway with his body and truck.  Husband returns, dad goes into his own house, we leave. It takes two weeks to get people to go with us (cops won\\'t and think I am a selfish POS for asking) to get as much of our stuff (mostly mine since the house was mine for 6 years and husband had moved in only 9) as we could. We have nowhere to go. End up staying with a stranger &amp; pressing charges. The Commonwealth attorney did not call me with the phone number I gave them and dropped the charges saying they couldn\\'t find me. They had to be brought back up and even then, the charges were altered based on the CA\\'s opinion of what happened. \\n\\nAfter my dad attacked me, my pedo uncle called and for some reason confessed to what he did to my sister. I have no fucking clue why. But what I do know is that I had a charged and workin dictaphone and caught his confession on recording. I gave it to two police agencies. All this reporting and hating people who didn\\'t report caused me to begin reporting everyone for everything, which included two other men who were adults and assaulted me when I was a child. One of them, the case would have at least three witnesses. The other, I got a full confession through messenger. No one has been charged with a crime. \\n\\nAnyway. My sister and dad are linked up against their common enemy: me. My family also hates: me. I have no one and nothing. For the last seven months I\\'ve been staying with someone to save money and move away to a place where my sister and dad will not know my location......... And also this morning, I found out that for ten out of the twelve months we\\'ve been married, during all of this shit, my husband has been hiding a gambling addiction. I found out on accident through a receipt email from the state lottery. I confronted my husband and after several rounds of lies and different calculations, he gambled ALL of our money away, and even has taken out a loan to try to cover the damage. It was over 6k. I have nothing. I have no one. No friends, definitely barely one close friend. I have no money, nowhere to go. No option but to let one more person fuck me over so at least I *might* get all my money back one day.... What the fuck.', 'Flair': 'Self Harm'}, 'Post 2': {'Title': 'I am desperate, can not sleep or relax when my daughter is not with me.', 'Text': 'I posted for advice/input a few months ago here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Custody/comments/weggz0/us\\\\_motion\\\\_to\\\\_show\\\\_cause\\\\_custody\\\\_issues\\\\_anyone/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Custody/comments/weggz0/us_motion_to_show_cause_custody_issues_anyone/)\\n\\nQuick recap: I had my daughter for 3 months; she did not want to go back to her mom, and I refused to force her to return to a home where she is called names and slapped in the face. The mother, after 3 months, went to the school early and took her out. She did go to the school once before, had our daughter called to the office and, in my daughter\\'s words, \"told me that this has gone on long enough. That you have had time to be better and now you want to be super-dad and that is not okay.\" Then she left. \\n\\nSo, I have questions. And I need, again, any input at all. I\\'m scared and confused for my kid. I don\\'t have a \"proper\" format in my mind but I NEED to get this out there into the ether.\\n\\nRegarding the recap: Her mother showed up at the school (the super-dad incident) about a month and a half ago. She did not try to take her home that day. Her other daughter, age 7, was pulled out of school immediately after HER father refused to return her himself. He was trying to get sole custody and immediately waffled; I am unsure why and he is, in my opinion, a coward. He is also the man who sent grooming messages to MY daughter, which the mother defended and even threatened to punish our kid because she didn\\'t \"explain to your father why those messages are normal\". \\n\\nI guess, after having typed that out, maybe I should just list the things her mother has done, and ask whether or not I should be concerned for my daughter\\'s safety. I apologize; my mind is fried from everything. So, here goes:\\n\\nThe proposed parenting agreement is monday through monday back and forth, with the wednesday going to the other parent. It\\'s labelled a \"check-in\" day so I can be sure my daughter is safe, and will not be away from her for more than 3 days. There are 3 clauses added due to the mother\\'s actions. \\n\\n1: No drugs (legal OR illegal) may be consumed while the child is in the parent\\'s care. \\n\\n2: Neither parent shall strike, intimidate, or harass the minor.\\n\\nand 3: Neither parent shall interfere with the personal liberty of the minor, nor interfere with the minor\\'s communication with either parent.\\n\\nHer first night back at her mother\\'s, she said mommy smelled like weed again (I know, it\\'s legal. I use it too. Just NOT around my kid). The next morning, while preparing for school, her sister lost her hairbrush and became frustrated, which led to crying. Her mother decided the best course of action was to: Spank the child for getting so frustrated, afterwards walking over to my daughter (who had nothing to do with the situation) in order to tell her \"Do NOT tell your father everything that happens here. I can spank the both of you. I can smack the both of you in the face if I want to!\" although she told me she was going to agree with the contract and all it\\'s clauses. She also attempted to gaslight me (I believe) by: telling me verbally that she will \"set up times she can speak to you, IF I decide it\\'s appropriate.\" \\n\\nI of course responded, \"The personal liberty clause was added because you take her phone away literally every day for ANY slight. She WILL have access to her father at all times.\" Now, I wondered why she was mumbling when she told me about setting up times, and after I got angry and hung up, she IMMEDIATELY texted me: \"I said she can call you or text you whenever she so pleases.\" and told my daughter I was being a baby. So, it\\'s clearly a game for her. Say one thing, text another in hopes that I\\'ll lose my temper? Hence the possible gaslighting. I\\'m told by my daughter mom also takes her phone away to read every message I send her and I believe that will result in my daughter \"watching what she says\" therefore interfering with her liberty and/or communication with me.\\n\\nOn another phone call, she was becoming angry that I want to claim her on taxes for the last 5 years until my daughter is 18. She does not want to budge on this, and ACTUALLY said, out loud, on speaker, with my daughter holding the phone (I was supposed to be talking with her but her mother HAD to interject): \"Do NOT get this confused. This is all about the money.\" My jaw dropped. She fucking admitted it. She honestly makes me sick.\\n\\nI know this is long, but I don\\'t want to list a bunch of her quotes without context. I honestly think this woman is unhinged. Our daughter\\'s old therapist said her mother was verbally and emotionally abusive. Upon finding this out, the mother said \"She\\'s too expensive. We\\'re not going back.\"\\n\\nAnd, speaking of quotes, here are a few: (With minimal context. I\\'ll be brief.)\\n\\nAfter her boyfriend left her, speaking to my daughter: \"YOU are the reason he left. It\\'s because of YOU and YOUR attitude.\" Same subject, separate incident: \"Stop driving the men in my life away!\" To me, regarding the breakup: \"I will NOT have a 12 year old run my love life!\"\\n\\nWhen I suggested that not everyone around her is a liar, and she probably needs help because she can\\'t possibly be wrong: \"I don\\'t need therapy. I\\'m not doing anything wrong, and I was NOT wrong for slapping our kid in the face more than once.\"\\n\\nAnother discussion regarding our daughter\\'s \"attitude\": \"When I look at her, I see you. She\\'s so negative.\" Same discussion: \"She just won\\'t stop poking the bear.\" Me: \"Okay, but why do you have to be the bear? Why can\\'t you just talk to her? Does it HAVE to be hitting?\" Her: \"SHE STARTED IT!\" Me: \"She\\'s 12 .... she \\'started it\\'? You\\'re saying a 12 year old is ruining your life?\" Her: \"I didn\\'t say she\\'s ruining my life. But my happiness comes first.\" Me: \"Your happiness comes before your kid\\'s happiness?\" Her: \"Well, my 2 daughter\\'s happiness is a close 2nd.\"\\n\\nI\\'ll stop with the quotes. This is getting to be too lengthy. I know it\\'s a bit sloppy and all but holy shit am I scared of this woman.\\n\\nA few random incidents:\\n\\nMy daughter received a violent threat from a bully, called a wh\\\\*re, sl\\\\*t and a b\\\\*tch to which her mother responded: \"Well, you were talking shit.\" I saw the emails. The first one was RECEIVED by my kid. She legit hadn\\'t done anything. No, my daughter\\'s not perfect but she is terrified of confrontation and wouldn\\'t say anything to provoke receiving that email. \\n\\nRegarding religion: Mom takes the daughter to church. She doesn\\'t like it, and wants to stop going. I remind mom we always said daughter can pick her own religion. Mom\\'s response? \"Well, she\\'s not going to grow up to be a satan worshipper. I mean, what are YOU wanting to teach her? The monkeys?\" Yes, that was verbatim.\\n\\nShe was caught by my daughter\\'s friend who was spending the night getting undressed and about to \"have some fun\" with boy toy in the living room, 5 feet from her sleeping 7 year old, bragged about it to her friend, and said \"It\\'s my right to f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* wherever I want. I\\'m an adult.\" and now denies the whole thing. Furthermore, my daughter says she\\'s uncomfortable \"at night when mom\\'s boyfriend is over. She just walks around the trailer with a t-shirt and thong even if we ask her to stop.\"\\n\\nShe has blamed our daughter for her romantic failures, yelled false molestation accusations at me in the middle of a walmart, allowed our kid to be groomed and even defended the guy who did it, and now lives in a trailer with her NEW boyfriend, her 2 daughters and his 3 daughters (and the 2 adults of course) with one bedroom. Her new boy toy, by the way, is CURRENTLY facing child endangerment charges, is a felon and has drug charges, has been accused of choking his own kids, and frequently hangs out with minors. Not exactly comfortable with all that.\\n\\nLast thing I will mention, I promise. My daughter told her mother it was okay to come back, and 50/50 is okay. If she\\'s okay with it, I\\'ll deal. However, she told me she only told her mother that because if she didn\\'t her mom would get mad at her again. Jesus, her most recent homework was a paper with rows of pictures of jars. Each jar has a label. One in particular, (labelled Trauma. Example: Parent/bully/abuser) was colored in, all the way to the top. This is of course a red flag, so I gently asked (after asking about other jars to show interest) \"Why is that one full?\" No hesitation, simple response. \"Because Mom.\"\\n\\nI promised I would stop and I will. I\\'ve told my lawyer we can\\'t agree yet because she \"agrees\" yet still thinks she can slap our kid all she wants. He\\'s supposed to call back by wednesday. I just couldn\\'t wait that long. I don\\'t know what else to do, who else to reach out to, ask to testify if need be, or just be a shoulder to lean on in general.\\n\\nIs this normal behavior from a mother? Am I completely and utterly wrong in thinking she\\'s becoming (if not already totally) unhinged? I\\'d rather have sole custody but am told by my attorney that\\'s nigh impossible. Regardless, I work THREE jobs to save money for whatever is coming, and still find time for my kid. It\\'s crucial that I have money for a long trial if it does come to that, however improbable.\\n\\nWhoever reads this: This is one sloppy situation and if you read it all, you are a saint. That being said,\\n\\nAny. Input. Please. Somebody. This situation is not improving, her mother has learned nothing. Help in ANY way if you can give advice.\\n\\nThanks in advance\\n\\n\\\\-A still legitimately terrified father', 'Flair': 'Trigger Warning'}, 'Post 3': {'Title': 'Introduction', 'Text': 'Hi, i am Chow.\\n\\ni actually have been on this subreddit for quite a few years. i have posted before vents and deleted them and posted drawings.\\n\\ni have finally gathered the courage to introduce and talk about myself in a more formal cathartic way.\\n\\nit is going to be long, i do apologise.\\n\\ni am 20 years old, female.\\n\\ni was diagnoses with paranoid schizophrenia when i was 12.\\n\\nfrom what i have found out, that is quite abnormal to have happened, let alone get a diagnosis at that age.\\n\\ni never knew at the time and in some way, i am rather grateful it was picked up this early on in my life.\\n\\nthough that didn\\'t subsequently lessen the effect of what has happened with myself to date.\\n\\nunfortunately now, my diagnoses has shifted to catatonic schizophrenia, but i will address this later on.\\n\\nwhen i was little, i was described as being very quiet, lonesome, disconnected even; i didn\\'t interact with other kids properly and i would say few words, bluntly with very little expression in face or tone.\\n\\ni admittedly was very nervous around other kids, i got very agitated by them, naturally i felt lost and confused.\\n\\nmy very first delusion, i ever experienced at 9 or 10, was myself believing i was a robot, created at a lab, to experience human life, and that the stars were cameras of my creators watching me interact.\\n\\nwhich made me feel pressured to act **\"human\"**.\\n\\ni don\\'t blame anyone for not noticing the signs really, as children tend to make believe some of the strangest and weirdest things, it would be hard for parents to understand.\\n\\nwhilst i was in a state of delusion, i was slowly seeing insects everywhere, i didn\\'t think much of it, as i spent my times outside a lot, which just made me think it was normal.\\n\\nbut then the insects spoke to me, and would end up all over my body.\\n\\ni heard infrequent disembodied voices from people, i would sometimes stare at them, knowing their mouth wasn\\'t moving but hearing them speak.\\n\\nand i believed i was a robot with telepathy and they were also the same as me, so i would try to communicate back with them.\\n\\nnow looking back, that must of been weird, having a kid blankly stare at you.\\n\\nmy parents weren\\'t exactly aware of my behaviour too much, as i kept to myself a lot.\\nit was mostly when one teacher, my science teacher had noticed i was acting odd, speaking / whispering to myself in full conversation with myself, or staring blankly off.\\n\\nshe reported it to my head teacher, which they took to my parents out of concern and my parents didn\\'t really act upon it, until they had a parent teacher meeting, with my science teacher and head teacher.\\n\\ni think some of other teachers may have reported or said something about my odd behaviour.\\n\\ni don\\'t actually know, anyways it was the driving force to get help for myself.\\n\\nand i was put through various professionals.\\n\\nthough, i was stupid as a kid, and was scared to talk, not out of delusion, just shyness and fear.\\n\\nit took a year or 2 years for them to finally conclude what was wrong, as it took a while for me to open up about my mind.\\n\\nwhen i joined academy, from 12 onwards till 18.\\n\\nit went downhill, aha.\\ni laugh now, because it was inevitable but silly.\\n\\nstress of school work, hormones, late social development, bullying and social isolation, isn\\'t a great combination when you mind isn\\'t exactly i guess, healthy ?\\n\\ntrying to think of it in a less stigmatised manner, anyways.\\n\\nin

only for these individuals to exclude, pick on me or spread rumours upon myself.\\n\\ni was very miserable, whilst also pressuring myself to keep up human appearances and behaviour, with my delusion of being a robot which had continued.\\n\\ni was struggling with school work, concentration and executing simple tasks.\\n\\nbasic school work was too hard, i created a fear around it, especially homework, where i would procrastinate or not do it at all.\\n\\nin this time, at 14, i got a phone, this is when i sought the online realm for connection and comfort away from my reality of it all.\\n\\ni became addicted to my phone, but as i was progressing in school, i was being heavily bullied for my appearance.\\n\\ni had become severly disconnected, i had no friends, no one to talk to and i would hide with my phone in school, so no one could find me.\\n\\nmy delusions ran rampant and i thought i would be saved by my creators from this place, i thought i wouldn\\'t have to endure the pain.\\n\\nand i tried to communicate with them, in my head, but majority of the voices in my head had been adopted from the kids at school, saying hateful horrible things.\\n\\nthough there were a few adult voices, they spoke of alienistic things and my creators, telling me to continue living this experiment, that it would worth it.\\n\\nsomewhat encouraging at times, which i thank them for, it felt nice to have someone believe in me, even if it was for means upon a delusion.\\n\\ni continued to struggle, my delusions stopped being focused upon uniqueness and being a robot and started to become more gruesome and disgusting, insects were more prevalent.\\n\\nit didn\\'t help that for drama class we had to watch a zombie movie, as we were going to pretend to be zombies.\\n\\ni started seeing decomposing corpses, limbs or trails of blood about.\\n\\nit then started afflicting my sight upon myself, i thought my skin was peeling off, like i was dying, insects crawling out of the open

least.\\n\\ni still get tormented by these things now, but i am somewhat slightly more welcoming or desensitised by it, if that makes sense.\\n\\ni will say, conversating with a zombie, is interesting.\\n\\ni believed now, i was dead, a walking rotting corpse among my peers, and that\\'s why nobody liked me, because i wasn\\'t alive.\\n\\nwhen final exams came, i failed them

The stress was so great in the family that my mother said she would blame me if she and my dad got a divorce. \\n\\nWhen I was dating him, I slowly saw myself get angry and turn into a different person, like I was losing myself. I wanted it to work out, so which is why I kept going. \\n\\nI was 18 at the time, and this was my first relationship out of High School. I think with him, he felt like he was babying me and we were at completely different paths at that time.\\n\\nHere are some things he did that really stick in my mind:\\n\\nI recently moved to the town and he was getting on me for not knowing the streets or where things were (he grew up his whole life in the town I believe)\\n\\nI told him for religious reasons I don\\'t drink coffee and he bought me a coffee in the city and we sat there and told me we couldn\\'t leave until I drank it. I kept refusing and he made such a fuss in public and was yelling at me and putting down my religion while a bunch of people stared. He eventually decided to leave and took the coffee and threw them in the garbage on the way out while still arguing about how I wasn\\'t drinking coffee.\\n\\nWe go into Macy\\'s and he wants to see if his ex-girlfriend was there and if I\\'d like to meet her. And then he tells me about some of the sexual stuff they did in the store. We didn\\'t find her, but in that moment I felt like I was shaking and felt it to be odd he was doing that. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere was a time we went to see Inception in theaters, which was exciting. Then he wanted to sneak into a movie without paying (he told me he did that all the time) and I felt so wrong about it. That was stealing. We sat down to watch Toy Story 3 but I remember feeling so angry at him and I couldn\\'t sit there any longer so I told him I wanted to go. He was upset about that. I remember feeling like I was boiling inside. No one\\'s ever done that to me.\\n\\nAnd I noticed he used torrent files, which I was taught never to do or to steal, and he was constantly into stealing.\\n\\nWhen I went to Disneyland after my graduation, I found out that an ex-boyfriend had died due to a heroin overdose from a friend (I turned this guy down in the beginning of the year because he did drugs), and I told my current boyfriend about it. He was super angry and explosive-angry and told me that I should be focusing on him, instead of my ex-boyfriend. But he just died! At that point, I saw him as an old faint friend that I wouldn\\'t really talk or hang with and that relationship didn\\'t get serious. Because of my current boyfriend\\'s reaction, I felt even more hurt because the guy just died. \\n\\nWhen I found out he looked at women at night, I told him it bothered me and he told me that if I didn\\'t like it, I should just leave. There was great explosive anger in that moment. As a young girl, I thought I was in love, so I decided to stay. I was also very shy and had way worse anxiety back then than I do now. I could barely talk to other people then, and he was an extrovert. He also acted like he was a gift to the world who achieved so much. His parents liked me, I could tell.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs a young teen I talked about marriage and he told me \"You\\'re just like Suzanne,\" and was getting bent out of shape again.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHe also told me that he believed in the survival of the fittest and that he wanted to date only women with blonde hair, and blue eyes. He also wanted to date someone with 20/20 vision like him (but his parents both had glasses?), and I wore contacts. I had dyed blonde hair and I wore contacts. So I had some things against me. I thought his belief was so strange and wrong.\\n\\nBehind my back, he was talking to his last ex-girlfriend (who seemed like she broke up with him by the way he was treating me and taking things out on me) about stuff about the relationship with me like she was his best friend or something and it seemed like she was talking him out of dating me because of our differences and how young I was. It seemed like it was killing him to break it off. He seemed emotionally torn. He told me he could possibly date me in 5 years because it wasn\\'t the right timing. It seemed like he was getting all personal with her about me, and I felt like my hopes of trust were shattered and I felt very hurt and raw.\\n\\nThere was so much anger and darkness in that relationship. I truly believe he was a narcissist. I think in the end I knew way more about him than he knew about me. He didn\\'t really try to get to know me, he kept wanting me to know all about him and what he\\'s done in life and what he has. I think in the end, he was calling me crazy because I still wanted to talk to him and wanted to work it out (which is strange he didn\\'t want to talk to me but he wanted to keep talking to his ex-girlfriend).\\n\\nI remember at that point in my life, I felt so low that I was willing to give up my standards to have a boy like me (I know it was wrong, still do).\\n\\nRegardless, time went on after that. I remember feeling torn and broken. I thought somehow we could make it work, or at least, was hoping he\\'d change (in my 18-year-old mind). I don\\'t know why I let him be abusive toward me (not physical - no bruises or anything, but emotional/sexual). I was so naive and was really craving attention. It was super exciting dating a college kid who had life experience while I still hadn\\'t left home yet. I saw possibilities, and it was exciting. But he was from a totally different ballpark.\\n\\nRegardless, I\\'m in my 30s now, and once in a while, I have him floating back into my mind. I have a husband and a family of my own and have achieved a lot since then. But for some reason, this relationship is like a \"core memory to me.\" I get shaky and feel like I am in danger. I wish I didn\\'t have this and I had never made the choice to date him.  But when I look at his picture or his business, I feel like he is my inner voice again, like I\\'m crazy for thinking about him or checking up once in a while. \\n\\nHow do I erase his inner voice of the things he said in the past? I know I shouldn\\'t glance, but I was hoping with time I would be over it. I don\\'t like him now, but I am surprised at how much this has affected me for so long. Many times, I\\'m fine. In my past, I kept doing things in life to go against his voice in my head saying, \"oh, yeah? I\\'m not as dumb as you think I am\". I am doing therapy but I haven\\'t gotten to this part of my life yet. \\n\\n  \\nRegardless, I\\'d love to hear from people who have anxiety as well and see viewpoints.\\n\\nThanks for reading if you\\'ve gotten this far and thanks for advance for responses.', 'Flair': 'Trigger Warning'}, 'Post 5': {'Title': 'my life is spiraling out of control due to anxiety', 'Text': 'I would like to preface this by saying I know I\\'ve lived a very fortunate life and I feel blessed to even be in this position to be able to post to this subreddit. \\n\\nI\\'ve turned 21 recently and I still cant help but live a life controlled by the anxiety I have. \\n\\nAll my life I\\'ve been the \"mistake\" of the family. I\\'ve never done good in school and was scolded constantly my entire childhood because of academics. I find that I was quite needy emotionally and my parents could never provide enough. My father was always in and out of my life and my mother would constantly move us, living with plenty of different men. Because of these things I found myself going to a different school almost every year from K-10th grade, when I eventually dropped out of school because they wouldnt let me in public school since I was so behind on credits. I was 16 when this happened. \\n\\nI told my mother I would get my GED when this happened and she effectively just let me do my own thing from there. This is when I locked myself in my room for years, playing video games 16 hours a day and  only leaving the house once every couple of months. I was already a shy kid growing up, skipping school because I was so anxious of everything was a common occurrence, I almost failed 8th grade because I had missed something like 30 days total throughout the year.\\n\\nOnce I dropped out, the guilt and anxiety of missing school moved to guilt of not doing anything with my life. And anxiety that I wasnt going to be able to complete my GED because i wasnt studying for it, instead just playing video games all day because I have no discipline. This went on for 2 years straight with very little interference of my behaviors. I would lock myself in my room and no one would try to stop me. Sometimes I wouldn\\'t even see or talk to anyone in the house for days or even weeks at a time. All of this made me incredibly guilty and anxious because I knew I wasnt doing the right thing and yet I felt like I couldn\\'t stop myself. During this time I was diagnosed with ADHD, Anxiety and Depression ( ADHD when I was 16, Anxiety and Depression when I was 17 ) \\n\\nDuring the ages of 16-18 there was little to no interference with my behavior whatsoever, infact I had never gotten in trouble a single time with my mother, which was something I\\'ve never experienced. However the moment i turned 18 things definitely started changing. I\\'m blessed enough to have a mother that didnt kick me out at 18 despite not going to school, although that was under the presumption I would get my GED when I turned 18. Well that time had come and I kept pushing it off because I was too scared of failure, and I didnt feel like I would ever be able to pass it. My mother became increasingly frustrated at this and was becoming more and more angry with me. My mother was the only person I\\'ve had consistently in my life and seeing her be so angry and cold towards me was heartbreaking. It sent these feelings of anxiety and depression into overdrive and eventually tried committing suicide because I couldnt bear the guilt of being such a failure my entire life, on top of this feeling of gender dysphoria I had for the past 6 years.\\n\\nObviously I made it out the other end and thankfully ended up surviving. It didnt change much for me in the long run. A visit to a psych ward ( and 2k debt ) for a couple weeks and I was effectively back to what I was doing before. However this time I decided to really try and get my GED, which I was able to get later that year after I had turned 19.\\n\\nBecause I\\'ve lived such an isolated life I had never been exposed to things like learning to drive a car, or getting a job. Things that most teenagers experience at some point. So now I\\'m 19, had got my GED, and was expected to go to college with no studying habits and 3 years of almost pure isolation from human contact in a tiny room with a computer.  I eventually went to a local college but I had to stay and the dorms, but I refused to share a room with anyone because of multiple factors. ( mainly the gender dysphoria but also I had not shared a space with anyone in half a decade, I didnt feel capable of it ). So this lead to a very expensive semester for me since I had never held a job in my life, around 22k for the semester. To even get in to the college I had to get my grandma to cosign the loan, which led to even more anxiety of failure, because even more pressure was being put on the line. \\n\\nLong story short, the amount of social anxiety I had prevented me from even being able to email a professor about anything. I ended up skipping every class out of anxiety after the first 2 weeks. All of this pressure I\\'ve never been used to amounted in constant anxiety attacks and I only ever left my dorm room in the middle of the night to avoid other people from seeing me. I ended up leaving that college after the semester and have been living back at home for the past year.\\n\\nMy mother has been constantly on my case (rightfully so) about getting a job. I tried my best and applied to everything in walking distance of the house since I dont know how to drive. I found a job at a fast food place and worked one day there. It was the most nerve wracking thing I\\'ve ever experienced. They just put me out there and expected me to know how to do everything, this was the first time I had worked in my life and I get extremely nervous in social situations. I was so close to having an anxiety attack during the middle of my shift, I\\'m sure to the other people working there I looked like a hot mess. I was constantly shaking, I was dropping customers change in the drive through, dropping food and panicking about dropping it. Just all around a terrible experience and I felt so awful about it. The owner had scheduled me for 3 9 hour shifts Friday saturday and sunday. But after the first day I just didnt come back, I\\'m terrified of being yelled at and the owner was someone who would yell at coworkers from what the shift manager was telling me.\\n\\nThat leads to now. I\\'ve turned 21 a couple months ago. I\\'ve technically never had a job, I\\'m mortified of driving because I dont trust that I wont get in an accident and the only experience I have with driving anything is a gokart from when I was 10 and it was a terrible experience I still remember to this day. Theres one store within walking distance realistically and my mother travels often for work so I cant consistently get a ride from anyone.\\n\\nTo be honest I feel trapped, my relationship with my mother has gone quite south over the years due to some talks we\\'ve had about my gender dysphoria issues and the fact that I\\'m essentially free loading right now. Every couple days or so she\\'ll ask me how the job hunt is going and I know she knows I\\'m just bullshitting at this point but I just dont know what to do or where to go. I\\'m trying to apply to a community college and do online courses but I just feel completely helpless. I\\'m 21, have 25k in debt with crippling anxiety and depression, and I\\'m terrified of getting a job because the only jobs I know I\\'ll get accepted at are jobs that revolve around satisfying customers and that\\'s just not something I feel capable of right now. \\n\\nThe only thing I\\'m even holding on to at this point is that I\\'ve lost a friend to suicide and I see how that can affect the people that love me, and I cant put them through that.

Because of her aggression towards myself, paramedics had to be involved, because of her aggression towards the paramedics police had to be involved. It was just the two of us in our home that day.\\n\\nToday it happened again. I had noticed over the last few days that she was acting a bit off, not alarmingly enough to cause concern, but a bit different. I knew for sure I would catch the signs earlier this time, and to an extent I did, but still not early enough.\\n\\nSeemingly out of nowhere after our walk last night she began to question and challenge everything I was saying in an aggressive or suspicious manner. I could tell from the look in her eyes, her fully dilated pupils that she was not herself anymore. She was trying to rope me in to her grasp, waiting for me to slip up and say anything wrong so that she could shred me apart. Nope, not this time. I gave her space while she hysterically watched trash on TV, but then got her to pause and come sit with me. I held her close in a quiet room for 3 hours and stroked her hair until she seemed to have fallen asleep. Nope. She randomly burst into laughter over some very boring joke (\"A man walks into a bar, shovel.\") and then tells more silly stuff that\\'s so so funny somehow. There\\'s nothing wrong with telling bad jokes or whatever, but the fact that she was telling them in our second language (that we almost never speak you each other) was a clear sign that she wasn\\'t entirely herself.\\n\\nEventually she fell asleep and slept through morning, I think. The next day she was still a bit off, not following her usual routine, sitting in strange places, random years, etc. I knew she was \"slipping\" into an episode, but I thought I still had time. I asked her to go for a walk with me to the lake, and as nicely as it started, it quickly turned bad. We live in a rural area, and as soon as we got to crossing the one real road nearby (small highway) she began to \"psyche out\" drivers by giving them an evil stare and walking towards the road as they drove past over 80kmh. She was practically playing chicken with cars and semi\\'s while she\\'s the pedestrian.\\n\\nI asked her to please stop that, shocked that she would even do such a thing. She said \"okay\" and stopped, just like that. While making our way to the lake I can tell she\\'s somewhat lost in her head, but at least being rational and calm, until the lake. It was a cold day, so the lake was frozen solid but it\\'s unseasonably warm otherwise and you could tell by looking at the ice that it wasn\\'t too thick anymore. Girlfriend walks off the dock, hardly tests the ice and walks out a bit. I ask her to please come back, I don\\'t think it\\'s strong enough right now to carry people (she weighs ~55-60kg). She refused and responded in our foreign language \"this ice will carry\" and proceeds to stomp on it to prove it\\'s strength and then rolls around and sits on it. I take a picture and message her mom everything that\\'s happening and make arrangements to go to her place after she\\'s home from work. Luckily the ice held (I knew it wasn\\'t horribly deep at that spot) but falling through would\\'ve required an emergency call because she would\\'ve gotten hypothermia before we\\'d get back home.\\n\\nWe got home without incident. I\\'m starving and a nervous wreck at this point, and I tell her I\\'m feeling anxious and stressed and ask if she\\'d go to her mom\\'s house with me. She happily agrees to go. I scarf down some leftovers and we hop in the car and go before she changes her mind. She\\'s rocking out and dancing and singing (she\\'s usually quite reserved) so hard that the car is shaking, and then reaches across me to flip off a passing police van. Luckily they didn\\'t see it, I don\\'t think, because they didn\\'t pull me over. I definitely don\\'t need that right now.\\n\\nFinally at her mom\\'s, things are calm, her mom noticed the mania right away from the look in girlfriend eyes and get behavior. We wait for girlfriends sister to arrive and have a nice dinner before \"the talk\" about taking her medicine, I brought a pack with. \\n\\nWithin minutes after talking about medicine girlfriend became very aggressive and defensive. She paced around the room gesturing with her hands, swinging her arms, huffing and puffing, struggling to keep composure. She sits on the floor and SCREAMS at all of us that she\\'s not taking anything, her life, her body, her rules, etc. For 3 hours we tried to rationalize with her and beg ask plead say and command her to take her meds or the ambulance will be called. She aggressively refuses and for no reason punched her sister in the chest! I barely saw it, but I heard it clearly. She has never been physically abusive before. We all back off and call EMS. \\n\\nAfter waiting for over an hour they finally show up, paramedics come in first but police are behind the door. Instant standoff. Hands on her hips she tries to stare into their souls and refuses to cooperate or answer their questions at all, but demands they tell her why they want to know anything or why they are there. She smacks and swings at her sisters legs several times which causes a problem and the police step in. She tries to get to the balcony, presumably to close herself out, but is blocked by her sister in front of the door. Girlfriend violently grabs her sister and uses her as a shield against the police cornering her. Sister breaks free and the police grab girlfriend by the arms as she\\'s screaming at them to let her go, that they have no right, etc, and demand answers from *them* why they\\'re even there. She says she just wants to go home (with me), but that option is long off the table. I wasn\\'t going home either, I was going to stay with my mom instead.\\n\\nThey sit her down on a table. She refused to talk to anyone, but responded rather positively to me, and let me try u or her shoes on for her since she refused to put them on herself. She didn\\'t make it easy and barely tried to push her feet in. Mom got the job done, but that was the easy part. She wasn\\'t going to walk either and went ragdoll. the police literally dragged her out of the house and with the paramedics carried her down 3 flights of stairs and out into the ambulance.\\n\\nOnce she was strapped in and paramedics and one officer seated by her, she started crying and talking and looking for me, her mom, and sister. We got to say our goodbyes, she was happy to give aggressive hugs and kisses. I asked her if she remembered the jokes she told the previous night, she did, and burst out laughing in the stretcher. She was manic, but I was happy she could at least smile for a second. Her mom hops in and gives her hugs. Girlfriend hugs squeezes and oddly shakes her mom and is crying hard, but soon stops. Her mom gets out and girlfriend is signaling hearts with her hands and reaching out to us in desperation as they close the door.\\n\\nMe, her mom, and sister cry our way back upstairs and group hug. we\\'re all hurting, sad, and trying to make sense of what just happened. Everything was going SO GOOD for over 4 years until these last episodes. We tried everything to give her the choice to take her meds or then it\\'s the ambulance. She refused refused refused and chose the hard way. I\\'m almost certain she\\'ll be held for more than 10 days this time, and I get to carry them household until then. What happens next I don\\'t even know, but for our relationship and house, it\\'s not looking good. \\n\\nTldr; girlfriend hospitalized again 8 weeks after previous manic episode and has become physically abusive.

I’ve had panic attacks before and have had anxious feelings when I was younger but they never really physically affected me until recently. My dad and siblings all have anxiety but I have not been properly diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.\\n\\nI had found what I thought was a cancerous lump on my testicles (it turned out to be a benign cyst thankfully) and it filled me with so much dread. I discovered it on New Year’s Eve and from them until 2 weeks ago I’ve been stressing and overthinking about dying from testicular cancer, it was always in the back of my mind, I could be having a wonderful day out with my girlfriend but as soon as I was home the thought would creep back into my mind to remind me that I could have cancer and I felt I could die from it.\\n\\nFast forward to about nearly two weeks ago, I woke up one morning feeling refreshed and not anxious for once. I was totally feeling fine, I got ready for school as is my usual routine. Then around 9AM I’m sitting in class and get hit with a stabbing chest pain in my sternum. I thought maybe I slept wrong or could have strained a muscle. Then the shortness of breath comes soon after and I’m at home that day after school freaking out over this pain in my chest. though I wasn’t totally convinced that it could be something serious so I soon forgot about it and the pain went away that evening.\\n\\nWednesday morning comes and the chest pain is back, I decided to skip school because of this pain and take a warm shower to hopefully calm me down and hopefully get rid of the pain. It doesn’t go away. After my shower I’m feeling anxious and I sit down on the couch in the living room. All of a sudden I get this sinking feeling, and I get tunnel vision like I can only focus on what’s in front of me, I start looking around frantically and get this feeling that I was absolutely going to die. I run to my sisters room and she calms me down and eventually after an hour or so I am calmed down, not completely but I manage.\\n\\n(All throughout this and as well as after this point I am searching up heart attack symptoms on Google and scaring myself even more, horrible thing to do I know.)\\n\\nThursday night I end up going to the ER because I’m worried and they check me out and do an EKG which turns out normal. They gave me a testicular ultrasound which came out good I just had a benign cyst. When I came back that night the pain was gone and Friday I felt great. \\n\\nI go home and for the next week the pain either changes or goes away completely. That Saturday I take my girlfriend out for her birthday and we’re having a nice time and I don’t notice the pain at all, I wasn’t feeling anxious and it was like it disappeared. I felt great this day too.\\n\\nMy pain comes back that Sunday night and for the next few days it changes, eventually the pain makes it’s way to my arm, then my neck, then my upper back, these pains can be with or without the chest pain. I’m also worried because the pain is primarily where I believe my heart to be but It can be in the middle of my chest as well as the right side.\\n\\nAt this point the root of my anxiety was moved to my chest pains instead of the cyst which I am no longer worried about.\\n\\nWednesday night I get some indigestion from some pizza I ate and I get scared cause I’ve heard of a heart attack being confused for indigestion or heartburn.\\n\\nThursday I have an appointment at my doctor to get my chest checked out, I’m always very nervous and anxious at the doctor and my fears get the better of me a lot of the time. They do an EKG and it shows that I have an AV block. They call EMS and I’m obviously about to have a panic attack so I suppress it the best of my ability and try my best to keep cool to help myself in this situation. EMS comes and they give me some baby aspirin to chew on and do another EKG. They determine that I don’t actually have an AV block but suggest I go to a hospital for some tests.\\n\\nWe go and this is the first time I’ve been to a big hospital like this so I’m pretty nervous but try my best to cooperate to make it easier on the doctors and nurses that are helping me. We did a blood test, chest X-ray and another EKG and everything turned out alright. They determined that the pain was not cardiac related but it’s hard to not feel like it is because of places that I experience the pain in. \\n\\nThat was last night, although it did calm my nerves some, it’s hard to accept. I still have the pain but I will try my hardest to not let my anxiety control me. \\n\\nIf anybody has any concerns or questions or wants to share a similar experience please feel free to do so!

I built up the courage and I went to the doctors and was prescribed mirtazapine (for anxiety and depression ) \\nAbout 3 months in and I never felt better all my anxiety or whatver it was , was gone I felt really good was in the gym everyday doing boxing running everyday eating any food I wanted without any problems living my best life . \\n\\nFast forward 2 years with 20  trips to A&amp;E and I am crippled to say the least , now I can no longer eat , when I do eat it has to be the healthiest food of all time like vegetables and plain chicken and rice and even at that i feel unhealthy. I no longer go to the gym or run or do boxing due to being afraid I’m going to keel over due to a heart condition , I can’t drink anything only water and water even effects me these days . I get chest pains every single day and constantly think I’m going to die of a heart attack . When the pains do come I jump up and run around like a mad man pacing back and forth hoping I don’t die , the pains come localised to one spot mostly feels like a nail being pulled in and out of my chest , other times it feels dull and just like a pressure or sensation in my chest . I get flutters everyday the only way to explain it is if somebody was flipping  my heart from the inside over and over again this can last up to 10 minutes .  I get constant palpitations or feelings of my heart dropping suddenly , skipped beats which feels like my heart rebooted and started again , pains in my arm like a trapped nerve dull aches in my shoulders and jaw , headaches from hell which stops me from doing anything , heart rate elevated nearly always high when resting or moving 120bpm , I get light headed when I stand up and feels like I’m under pressure all the time , hard to explain through text  but I feel under pressure and light headed when I bend down or move suddenly. I get feelings of ice cold sensations in my chest and arm , lumps in my throat constant coughing /sniffing moving my shoulders back and forth to try keep moving &amp; rid whatver it is that’s making me feel this way , I wake up from sleep with chest pains, that is when I do get to sleep current suffering from severe insomnia (more so afraid to sleep incase I don’t wake up ) random pains all over my body , when I drink water I can feel the water flowing through my chest with every mouthful , the medication I’m on seems to be non existent right it went from numbing everything to now being afraid to take it….now im currently going through the worst part of my life  ,  I stopped my medication for a full month went cold Turkey (without doctors say so )  I had a bad episode about 3 months ago I was trembling chest pains cold / sweats pins and needles in hands and feet could only lie kinda face down to the side to relive any pains bed bound for 3 weeks didn’t eat for nearly 2 weeks only an apple or banana a day dropped 15kg in weight in 2/3 weeks  , continued to get pains coming and going after weeks went to the hospital they said I had a viral infection and that my heart and stuff were all healthy and that was the root of the chest pains which I didn’t believe because I didnt have a viral infecion for 4 months  , they mentioned I might have an over active thyroid which I still don’t know what that is. \\n\\n I have been to my doctors 20 times in the last year I’ve been to my local hospital 12/13 times throughout the year , I’ve had countless ecgs /blood tests / chest X-rays all coming back normal but when I say I do not feel normal I mean it I feel like I have a illness or heart issue or something they keep missing , my doctor tells me that I’m making it all up and that I’m immature but how can u explain to people that everyday feels like it’s going to be your last and that u always live in constant fear of dying in your sleep or having a heart attack when you eat or something , I know what my anxiety is and this just feels different , I don’t feel anxious unless I’m getting chest pains so I can’t explain any further . \\n\\nI am going to a private hospital this morning who specialise with hearts to get multiple tests done on my heart I really want to get to the bottom of why I feel so much dread and fear of dying from a heart attack and the pains and aches I have everyday , it’s a battle to get through everyday and I just need answers I feel so mentally and physically drained I’ve had to quit my job give up exercise , lost all friends from thinking in a freak of nature have 0 social life , I just sit at home waiting for the worst to happen.

What’s wrong with me?', 'Text': '29-make. I have severe ADHD and high functioning ASD. Growing up I experienced severe anxiety, I would worry about and overthink everything. It was so bad I could never fall asleep I had a chronic fear of not falling asleep and would become so anxious and trapped in my mind that I would go into fight or flight and surge with adrenaline until I was dripping with sweat, having heart palpitations, felt like a was having a heart attack and got severe diarrhoea. This was daily. I’d have panic attacks and get so anxious in daily life I’d sweat uncontrollably. \\n\\nIn my early twenties I developed a severe depressive disorder and thought of killing myself daily. I was morbidly obese and undiagnosed for ADHD. \\n\\nOne day I woke up and it was like something inside me had broken. As if all the anxious episodes, depression and apathy had just completely ceased and a light that was dim all that time had just miraculously switched back on and my engine started running again. \\n\\nSuddenly, there were no two week diets before giving up. I looked in the mirror and it seemed so logical. I want to lose weight, so just do it. Stop making excuses and thinking about it. Just do it. I dropped 70kg over the next two years and it was easy. I started having sex and building my confidence. I was more sociable and bedtime went from being a tortuous experience to my favourite time of the day. Everything became a simply logical equation. Will I fall asleep? Yes. Is anything but me stopping that? No. It was like when you mature and stop being afraid of the dark, I know monsters aren’t real, so why would I fear them? I know I’ll fall asleep, so why fear not doing so? I fall asleep within minutes now and almost wish I would be able to lay there longer enjoying the only time I have to just switch off and relax. \\n\\nIt all sounds so miraculous, but it’s all encompassed by a deep and consuming emptiness. As f I survived that depression only to come out the other side a colder and harder person. Like a part of me did die before I was able to live again, but now I don’t care about anything - I just do. The anxiety was crippling, but now I don’t care about anything. \\n\\nMy work gives me purpose, but without it I do and am nothing. I have no drive to date or find a partner. I do not socialise unless I can’t avoid it. Without an external factor to push me forward or out of myself, I’m just - nothing. But it’s not like being depressed. I still laugh and cry. I still maintain my appearance and I’m passionate about my job. I still enjoy life. But for me and my needs I just don’t care. \\n\\nI am incapable of being anxious now. I worry about nothing - I just exist as if everything will work out for me, and it almost always does. Whatever will be will be and  unless there is an obvious way I can control a scenario or fate I spare it no mind. I get frustrated and annoyed,  I feel stress. But not anxious. Everything is just a cold and logical equation and rational in thought. \\n\\nBut whereas anxiety was crippling and I do not wish I return to such a tortuous existence. The opposite is almost just as bad. Anxiety within reason helps you to care - it means you care. I miss that sinking feeling in my stomach, I miss the increase in heart rate and the internal drive to focus on and fix something because it’s important to you or because you fear it. \\n\\nWhere myself is concerned, not my job, family or friends. I fear nothing anymore, I worry about nothing, I care about nothing. For the longest time I was so happy with this change, my life was better in every way. But as time goes on I realised something was missing, something had died inside, and it’s never come back. I feel empty - but not sad. I don’t despair for what I lost, I don’t really know what it is I lost. I just kind I woke up one day and it was just gone. And almost six-years-later it never returned. \\n\\nI honestly feel like someone could walk up to me and stab me in the stomach and I’d just look down at the blade like ‘well, that sucks doesn’t it, but what’re you going to do? Oh-well’. \\n\\nI’ve told my psychiatrist about this and he says with all that’s happened in my earlier twenties (depression, abusive relationship, calamities) I was so overwhelmed that this was a defence mechanism for self-preservation. But it’s never gone away and I feel torn between two selves. This empty, cold shadow of myself I am when I’m alone, and the bright, bubbly, energetic self I am when I wear whatever mask I have to to appease those when I’m not alone. I feel like a sociopath now. I’m impulsive by nature due to ADHD so I even started doing things that would otherwise produce anxiety - drink driving, stealing - any risky behaviour. No matter what it was I felt nothing, no worry, no concern. \\n\\nAnd even now I don’t write this worried about what’s wrong with me - but I can’t find anything to help explain why I am the way I am now. \\n\\nAny personal accounts, resources or information anyone can direct me to would be much appreciated.', 'Flair': 'Health'}, 'Post 5': {'Title': 'THC edibles landed my in the ER and cardiology ward with tachycardia and an extreme panic attack.', 'Text': 'I tried posting this on r/trees and got predictably downvoted to hell and accused of being a shill for anti marijuana laws or some shit. \\n\\nI’ve been taking edibles for a couple years. Maybe 10, 15 times max. I’d take it months apart usually so my tolerance was really low. I’m also a 115 pound female and always seem to have strong side effects to substances. Recently had a pretty shitty case of COVID and cold so I was pretty weak physically - my first mistake.\\n\\nIt was the evening and I was at my parents house. They’re pretty chill about cannabis ever since it got legalized and so I took some edibles thinking it would help me relax. I took 10 mg (usually I take 5 or 7.5 mg) but recently I was worried my tolerance was going up because I wouldn’t feel much. I forgot I had a glass of wine with dinner.\\n\\nUsually it takes 2 hours for the edibles to kick in. After 20 min I knew something was terribly, terribly wrong. Time seemed to be warped for me. I couldn’t focus on the TV show I was watching. I felt reality slowly fade away and I felt trapped in this strange world where I couldn’t focus on anything around me. I started to panic. My heart was racing. I ran into my bedroom and begged my mom for water as my mouth was dry.\\n\\nThe water wasn’t helping. I could barely tell the passage of time - was in 10 minutes or an hour? I couldn’t remember what I had said 5 minutes before. My whole spatial awareness was warped. Eventually my mom put a Fitbit on me and noticed my heart rate was 175. Here’s where things get fucked.\\n\\nI lie down. I literally can’t move and voices feel warped. My whole body starts to shake and vibrate and I can’t move. I can barely speak - I want to but the words don’t come out. I vaguely hear my family yelling in the background and talking about calling 911. I keep repeating I’m going to die, and I think to myself, this is literally how I will die. My chest hurt. I was having trouble breathing. Finally my mom decides to take me to the hospital. \\n\\nThe drive to the hospital was the longest of my life even though it was 15 min. I felt like my lungs were shutting down and my chest hurt. I kept repeating that I couldn’t breathe and that I was dying. I could barely see anything and I remember trying to vomit into a bag. I was in a haze as I was wheeled into the emergency room. \\n\\nFinally I was connected to an IV and given fluids and benzos. My heart rate was still 175 and finally went down to 155 after an hour but wouldn’t stabilize even with the benzos. They gave me an EKG and a chest X-ray and took blood and it came back normal except for a little spot in my lungs which they thought was related to the COVID. I was still delirious at this point.\\n\\n \\nFinally around 4 am my heart rate went down to 135-125 and after two additional bags of fluids and some potassium (which was low) I was admitted to the cardiology ward for further observation. I fell asleep thank goodness and woke up the following morning getting more fluids. My heart rate was still elevated to around 125 but then went down to 115 and 100. I waited for the doctor until 3 pm and he said I’d be discharged as the THC was most likely close to being out of my system and my heart rate was now at normal levels. I was basically diagnosed with tachycardia from the THC, which was exacerbated by a full blown panic attack.\\n\\nI went home and that night I still felt spatially weird, shaky, and anxious. Today I feel better but my heart rate is around 100. I don’t think it’s fully out of my system yet and am now experiencing some trauma from the experience. I am scared of being alone and I am scared of going “crazy” or feeling like I am going to die again. This was easily one of the most traumatic and uncomfortable experiences of my life.\\n\\nI can’t begin to describe to someone who has not gone through a full blown THC induced panic attack how terrifying the lack of control and spatial disorientation is. And the feeling that something is very, very wrong with you and all you can do is wait for it to go away. I was told on r/trees that all I needed to do was watch a movie and relax and I’d feel better. \\n\\nI wholeheartedly disagree with that as the doctors were concerned about my heart and  the fact that they admitted me to the cardiology ward means it could have been a lot more serious. \\n\\nI am recovering but I do not feel back to normal yet. Hopefully I will soon but I need to do therapy work after this. My left side of my chest still hurts sometimes and I get pangs of anxiety and panic throughout the day.\\n\\nIf you have anxiety please, please be careful with edibles. I am not against cannabis. It is legal in most states like alcohol. But I want to stress how dangerous the paranoia and panic can be for some people who have anxiety disorders. If this post can help one person avoid what I went through I would be so happy.  \\n\\nTL;DR: I ended up in the ER and cardiology ward due to edibles. Tachycardia + anxiety attack is no fun.', 'Flair': 'Health'}}, 'medication': {'Post 1': {'Title': 'My experiences with Hydroxyzine', 'Text': 'Possible triggers: passing out/fainting, needles kind of but not really  \\n\\nHydroxyzine was the first anxiety medication I was ever prescribed, as I was diagnosed with GAD a few years back, but I was only prescribed the medication more recently (around April or May of 2022). I take other medications for mental health as well (bipolar, ADHD) but this was the first and only prescribed medication for anxiety I’ve ever been on. I forgot exactly why I was prescribed it but I assume I described some sort of anxious situation to my psychiatrist and he put me on it, 25mg pills to be taken up to twice a day as needed. I’ve only ever actually used it a few times, though, 4 to be precise, and the reason I don’t use it more is because every time I feel it does more harm than it does good, so I wanted to list my experiences here, for whoever to read and if anyone has any similar experiences or thoughts if they could comment them here I’d love to read them.\\n\\nExperience 1, the first time I’d taken Hydroxyzine. I was in the beginning stages of an anxiety attack because of something social media related, I don’t quite remember what but this was close to when I was first prescribed the medication so I figured I’d give it a shot. I misread the bottle, which like I said says to take up to 2 a day as needed, however I thought it said to take 2 a day as needed, so basically I took 2 at once for a total of 50mg when I really should’ve only taken 25. It made my heart rate sky rocket, I almost immediately felt dizzy and out of it, I couldn’t understand like what was going on around me. I was lucky to be in my room at the time because I passed out almost immediately after taking it. I was naturally freaked out slightly after that, and told my psychiatrist about it who told me that I definitely wasn’t supposed to take 50mg especially for my first time trying it, but that feeling tired is a normal side effect so me falling asleep right after taking it was normal. In retrospect I’m pretty sure my first experience wasn’t entirely normal like he said it was, though, and was me passing out from QT prolongation which I read is a possible side effect of the medication, and is why I had the whole heart thing going on (I also have preexisting heart conditions so I’m sure that made it worse).\\n\\nExperience 2. I went to go get my COVID booster shot, which was probably a month or two after my first experience with Hydroxyzine. I get really bad anxiety around needles, so I decided to give just half a pill (around 12mg) a shot to lower my anxiety for the shot itself. I took it probably 20 minutes before I got the shot, I didn’t feel AS anxious as I normally do when I take it but I still felt pretty anxious so I’m not sure how much of an effect it really had, and it honestly might’ve just been a placebo affect. I did notice my heart rate sped up again, however I’m not sure if this was the result of the drug this time or just the needle thing. I did go to sleep pretty early after taking it but I didn’t notice too much effects this time probably from the small amount.\\n\\nExperience 3, I went to go get a nose piercing. This was late July. Same reason as experience 2, I have a bad fear of needles so I took my medication prior to getting the actual piercing. This time I took a whole pill however, so 25mg, and I definitely felt the effects of it, however not quite the way I needed to. Similarly to my first time using it, my heart rate kicked up almost immediately after taking the drug, which is NOT what I wanted to happen and made my anxiety way worse. However, by the time I actually got to the piercing chair I had calmed down significantly, and my heart rate had slowed down almost completely (but not in a normal way, in a way where it was like, loud but felt way too slow).  I was also basically going to fall asleep the entire time I was getting the piercing and audio around me felt slightly distorted, like I couldn’t fully understand what people were saying, lights were brighter than they should’ve been and I couldn’t really focus, however this effect eventually went away. The drowsiness and general dizziness however did not go away, and I’m very glad I had a ride home from the piercing shop (I had went with a friend who was also getting a piercing), because I’m almost certain had I driven there myself I would’ve gotten in a car crash with how out of it I felt. Immediately after I got home I fell asleep and slept for a solid 14-15 hours.\\n\\nAfter this time I should’ve probably brought it up to my psychiatrist again, however whence our meeting came up it was over the phone while I was busy doing something else, so it completely slipped my mind, especially with how infrequently I was using the medication compared to my others, and after that I just kind of forgot about it.\\n\\nExperience 4, today. Last night around midnight I couldn’t fall sleep, I’d been trying for hours. I was incredibly sick, and the lack of ability to sleep was making me anxious. I haven’t been able to sleep properly in over a week because of how sick I’ve felt. I’d tried melatonin, tea, yoga, whatever you can think of in terms of sleeping solutions, but nothing worked. So, my own personal solution to both to my lack of ability to sleep and the anxiety it was causing me: Hydroxyzine, the drug which has successfully made me pass out or go to sleep within 2-3 hours of using it every time (and stay asleep for like, 12-15 hours after taking it). This was at midnight and I was tired, and in my desperation to go to sleep I kinda forgot why Id been avoiding taking the drug even when I do get really anxious, and took 25mg. It didn’t work, which just made me more anxious, I don’t know why since every other time its done SOMETHING but this time it did absolutely nothing. It still took me over an hour after that to fall asleep, and I didn’t stay asleep either. I did, however, notice effects of the drug today, around 13 hours after taking it. I went to drive through a place for lunch, and after eating in my car I went to go pickup refills of my other medications from the pharmacy. I went into CVS and almost immediately felt the feeling I felt in the piercing shop, where audio was distorted, lights were brighter and I couldn’t focus. I picked up my refills quickly and headed back to my car, where I just sat for a solid half an hour before I felt enough of myself to drive. When I got back home I took a 2 hour nap almost immediately. Even though this happened, like I said, 13 hours after taking the Hydroxyzine, I’m still almost 100% convinced this was a result of it as it felt almost exactly the same as Id felt when I took it at the piercing shop and similar to the first time I’d ever taken it, and I haven’t really ever felt like that at a time where I hadn’t recently taken Hydroxyzine.\\n\\nIn summary, I’m probably never going to take this drug again, since it does little to actually relieve my anxiety and at least for me the side effects seem to out way the very little good it does me. I’m curious if anyone has had similar experiences, especially with the heart rate and passing out after thing, and the effects/side effects only really kicking in the next day after taking it. I’m definitely going to talk to my psychiatrist about alternative anxiety medications because this really isn’t working for me.', 'Flair': 'Medication'}, 'Post 2': {'Title': 'A poem about my personal

Dextromethorphan does not have a significant affinity for the mu-opioid receptor activity typical of morphinan compounds and exerts its therapeutic effects through several other receptors.[6] In its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as a white powder.[7]\\nDextromethorphan is also used recreationally. When exceeding approved dosages, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative hallucinogen. It has multiple mechanisms of action, including actions as a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor[8] and a sigma-1 receptor agonist.[9][10] Dextromethorphan and its major metabolite, dextrorphan, also block the NMDA receptor at high doses, which produces effects similar to other dissociative anesthetics such as ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine.\\n\\nDextromethorphan has been found to possess the following actions (&lt;1\\xa0μM) using rat tissues:[14][30]\\n* Uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor via the MK-801/PCP site[30]\\n* SERT and NET blocker (cf. serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor)\\n* Sigma σ1 receptor agonist\\n* Negative allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors\\n* Ligand of the serotonin 5-HT1B/1D, histamine H1, α2-adrenergic, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors\\n\\nDextromethorphan is a prodrug of dextrorphan, which is the actual mediator of most of its dissociative effects through acting as a more potent NMDA receptor antagonist than dextromethorphan itself.[31] What role, if any, (+)-3-methoxymorphinan, dextromethorphan\\'s other major metabolite, plays in its effects is not entirely clear.[32]', 'Flair': 'Medication'}, 'Post 4': {'Title': \"My doctor suggested Seroquel, and I'm starting to think that I need it\", 'Text': 'Hello!

We\\'ve officially talked twice.\\n\\nThe biggest change to my routine is that I found a night shift job. I love it, it\\'s in my field, and I\\'m good at it. However, this is officially the first time in my life that I haven\\'t been sleeping great for reasons that aren\\'t related to hypomania. Predictably, my mood has been swinging more than it was previously. I\\'ve made it through, and the depression always goes. I\\'m one of those guys who needs 8-10 hours of sleep to feel good. I\\'m getting 3-7, spread out over a few naps. It\\'s not ideal. \\n\\nUnfortunately, my biggest symptoms of poor sleep have always been depression and relationship paranoia. I have a lot of tools, thankfully, so I see them for what they are, and I haven\\'t self-sabotaged. I\\'m worried that that won\\'t always be the case, though. Plus, I don\\'t want to keep worrying my loved ones (my support system is pretty good at the moment). \\n\\nI love being alive and functioning, but the depression can be pretty major, I\\'d say 7/10-9/10 bad (without SI or SH) for reasons that don\\'t warrant it. It goes down to manageable levels after about an hour, though, if not going away entirely. \\n\\nI talked to my new psych, and he is honestly already my guardian angel (within reason). I will see him in 2 weeks, if not sooner. He gave me the location of the best ER nearby (in case of emergency) and told me what med changes he\\'d make, provided it still seemed like a good idea at our first appointment.\\n\\nI\\'ve always found a lack of functioning/severe brain fog to be the major drawbacks of any bipolar meds I\\'ve tried. I\\'m on vraylar and lamotrigine, and they are neutral for me so far in this regard. He will keep them the same, or maybe up them a bit. But he also suggested starting seroquel. I\\'ve never had it.\\n\\nI told him my only concern (other than that I\\'ve been hospitalized due to some antidepressants) is that it\\'s not weight-neutral for most people. I had a bad experience with 1 med (I gained 60 lbs in 6 months), and I\\'m only just starting to fix it. (I\\'ve lost 25 lbs since getting off of it in October. Can I get a \"nice\"?) He said that frankly, most of his patients do gain 5-10 lbs, max 20. But he said that the stability and sleep most people get are absolutely worth it. Also, in his experience, a good number of people lose it when their lives become stable. As someone who\\'s woken up 3-4 times a night for 15 years, who hasn\\'t truly passed out in probably a few years and has 3-6 unique dreams a night... I\\'m starting to believe him. A night of rest seems miraculous. \\n\\nMy weight loss wasn\\'t intentional so far. It\\'s an effect of my meds, and I\\'m not complaining quite yet. I\\'m finishing maybe half of 2 meals a day. So, hopefully, the lower appetite and increased appetite can cancel each other out? Lol, is that too hopeful? If that can be true, then it would absolutely be worth it. \\n\\n That said, adding a new med is always scary. I was hoping someone here could be reassuring, or maybe even share a success story! And don\\'t worry too hard about the sleep. I was given his blessing to stock up on benadryl and melatonin for the time being (and he said he\\'d talk to my GP and make his suggestion, if I can get seen by that guy sooner, and if that guy would consider prescribing it as well). I also happen to have a lot of time off work for being physically ill recently. The only reason I didn\\'t start seroquel ASAP is because of the potential liability of the psych prescribing for someone he\\'s talked to only twice, without an official intake appointment, especially since I presently seem fairly stable.\\n\\n\\n\\n*Tl;dr: I\\'m doing well, but I\\'m not sleeping.* I don\\'t feel manic, and I\\'m functioning, but I have what I recognize to be mild paranoia and recurring, severe depression. I still feel hopeful, if not excited. My new doctor says seroquel may be a great addition, but I\\'m nervous due to potential physical and mental side effects, and I have never tried it. \\n\\nHow do y\\'all feel seroquel has changed your lives? Other than weight gain and more sleep, what can I possibly experience? Thanks for any and all replies. I\\'ll be reading about it, but anecdotes are more fun and reassuring than clinical data. Thanks! \\n\\nAlso, if this is the wrong community, please let me know.

The human being can be compared to an ignorant child, who enjoys the sweets only and is reluctant to chillies. Hence, such a human being is ignorant. The grown up adult enjoys both sweets and chillies in the meals. Similarly, a realized soul enjoys both happy situation and miseries in the life. Therefore, it is only ignorance, which is the inability of art of enjoyment. God created this world with happiness and misery. People enjoy the cinema, which contains both pleasant scenes and tragic scenes. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSimilarly, people enjoy both sweet dishes and hot dishes in the meals. People enjoy the day and night. People enjoy the hot summer and the cold winter. The whole life and creation is full of alternating happiness and misery. If a person can enjoy both happy times and miseries in the life, he is equal to God. You may say that God enjoys the creation from outside. God also enters the creation in the form of human incarnation and enjoys both pleasant times and miseries in the life span. We see this truth in the life history of Rama and Krishna. Therefore, if you always crave for happiness only and reject miseries, it is unnatural and also ignorance of a child. The knowledge of the Gita preaches that you should enjoy even a top most misery, which is the time of death.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf you enjoy both miseries and happy situations, you are in a continuous state of enjoyment. You think that continuous enjoyment comes only through continuous times of happiness in the life. It is not correct. You get bored if you are served only with sweet dishes in the meals. Boring is misery. Therefore, misery is inevitable like summer after winter and winter after summer. The Indians denote happiness through cooling. The foreigners represent happiness through warming, which is heat. Therefore, the happiness to one is misery to the other. What is the reason? The foreigner is mainly exposed to winter, which bores him. Therefore, for a foreigner, the heat is happiness.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n The Indian is mainly exposed to summer and therefore, cool atmosphere is happiness to him. This is a practical proof that the enjoyment is not confined to happy scene or tragic scene only. This also proves that you can enjoy both happiness and misery. Therefore, it is ignorance to ask God for removal of misery and sanction of continuous happiness. Happiness should lie in the process of enjoyment. Whether it is misery or happiness, you will find real happiness in the process of enjoyment of both. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe happiness neither lies in the sweet dish nor in the hot dish. The happiness lies in the process of eating the dish, which may be hot or sweet. If this secret of life is known, you will never pray God for removal of problems and tensions. You will enjoy the problems and tensions and hence, there is nothing to pray God for something. Your prayer to God must be due to your attraction to Him for His excellent personality. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nYour praise of God must be based on your love for His divine personality. But, today we find most of the people praying God for sanction of continuous sweet dishes. Therefore, the desire for something gets smashed if you know the secret of this concept. Hence, there is no meaning in wishing somebody for a happy new year because continuous happiness bores and leads to misery only. The aspiration for continuous happiness through out the year is based on foolishness and ignorance.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOn the New Year, you must pray God thinking His divine personality and get attracted for His divine quality. You must at least achieve one of His basic qualities, which is enjoying both happy scenes and tragic scenes in the creation. On the Telugu New Year day, people generally take sweets and sour items mixed as offering of God (Prasadam), which shows the same concept of enjoyment of both happy and tragic movements in the life. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis is the divine knowledge in nutshell present in all the divine scriptures of all religions. This is essence of the Gita preached by Lord Krishna. He enjoyed continuously in His life and even in the last situation, when He was shot dead by a hunter. This is essence to be learnt and practiced by every human being in this world. \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[WWW.universal-spirituality.org](https://WWW.universal-spirituality.org)\\n\\nUniversal Spirituality for World Peace', 'Flair': 'Medication'}}, 'advice': {'Post 1': {'Title': \"Bipolar 2 and Divorce: This Forum and the Patterns I've Witnessed\", 'Text': 'I\\'ve been considering posting here all year. In fact, I even wrote up a 3000 word post two months ago documenting my entire story in vivid detail. But I couldn\\'t bring myself to post it. Despite the pain and abuse inflicted by my ex-wife, I wasn\\'t comfortable airing specific details of her mental health challenges to the world, even anonymously.\\n\\nHere\\'s the short, hyper-anonymized version.  A year ago my ex-wife abruptly started acting strange. We had been together for a ten years, and married for six. Seemingly overnight she experienced an acute personality change consistent with bipolar 2 that was recognized not only by me but many of our mutual friends. Ultimately, she left me for a much  (much) older, much less professionally accomplished and stable man. She abandoned all of our mutual friends, and I haven\\'t heard from her since the divorce was finalized.\\n\\nAbout a month after the separation, a close friend of mine mentioned that she thought my ex was experiencing hypomania. My friend had a childhood friend that married someone with bipolar 1, and she recognized similar symptoms in my ex-wife. I knew little about bipolar, and nothing about bipolar 2. I immediately went to the DSM, and thought back to our conversations. I quickly realized that my ex, surely without realizing it, had told me that she had every single one of the seven symptoms of hypomania over the course of three months. Obviously she is undiagnosed and I am not a mental health professional. Despite whether or not she would be diagnosed in a clinical setting, many of the experiences documented on this subreddit are identical to what I experienced.\\n\\nThis subreddit has been enormously helpful to me to get my head around what happened to a person that was my greatest love. There are so many posts that I\\'ve read here with sentences or even full paragraphs that I could have written myself. The purpose of this post is to summarize some of those patterns that I experienced that aren\\'t verified \"symptoms\" of bipolar 2 disorder. You can look at the symptoms in the DSM-5 for mania and hypomania. But what\\'s interesting is there are *patterns* not listed in the DSM-5 that appear to come out in many bipolar relationships, and recognizing them can help. They might not help you save the relationship, but they might help you stop blaming yourself and take control of your story of the relationship or its demise.\\n\\nThese four patterns primarily apply to my experiences and reading about marriages containing people with bipolar type 2. It didn\\'t experience any full-blown psychosis symptoms (well, seeing visions and hearing voices might count, but that was the only one), so I suspect this will generalize best to bipolar 2 and not bipolar 1.\\n\\n**Grandiosity (and its Ball and Chain)**\\n\\nA bipolar partner may either gradually or rapidly come out of a period of depression and melancholy and into a state of absolutely loving the hell out of life. What\\'s interesting on this subreddit, is that there are many phrases or sayings that appear consistent across cases. You might hear things like \"life is so short,\" or \"I love my life and my body so much.\" At first this will probably strike you as a good thing, and you\\'ll try to support it. But it\\'s unlikely to remain at this level.\\n\\nPartners may start to say things like: \"I need to discover truth,\" \"I need to become my full/true/most vibrant self,\" \"I need to shine,\" or \"I need to come into my full energy/light/radiance.\" What\\'s interesting is that these may have been things that they have said to you all throughout your relationship, but they will start to occur with greater frequency, ferocity, and a sense of urgency.\\n\\nNow, I think they really believe they need to make changes, and perhaps blow up their marriages to come into this truth or energy. A common phrase is: *\"If I don\\'t \\\\[xyz\\\\], I will die.\"* With *xyz* being anything: opening a brewery, moving to Liberia, going to a casino and gambling, using new hallucinogenic drugs, dancing all night in the street, or (most likely) having sex with or leaving you for someone else.\\n\\nNow, you\\'re likely an impediment, a ball and chain, preventing this full radiance from coming into fruition. If they are diagnosed, you try to get them help or to take medicine. If not, you just try to spend time with them and make sure they stay healthy (let\\'s say, by cooking for them so they eat enough while their decreased appetite, decreased sleep, hyperactivity and over-exercise causes them to shed an unhealthy amount of weight). They may begin to disdain being around you. They probably don\\'t want to go to couples therapy with you or have productive conversations about the relationship. \\n\\nIf they do care that they are putting you in a deep state of anxiety, they weigh that much less highly than their need to soar like an eagle or else risk their primal souls shriveling and dying. They might tell you that they \"don\\'t owe you anything,\" even if they said wedding vows (and meant them) or if you have children together. In their minds, they \"owe it to themselves\" to pursue freedom or someone else. Their vows aren\\'t their own or their responsibility, they are radiant beings that \"know a truth\" greater than society\\'s conceptions of love and commitment.\\n\\n**Empathy**\\n\\nYou\\'ll suffer as they abuse and threaten to leave you. They may or may not empathize with you.  I found a small body of (not very conclusive) scientific research that links the empathy centers in the brain to the disease. Interestingly, these studies find that bipolar can lead to either hyper-elevated levels of empathy or near zero levels. The ability to be empathic also appears to vary with the current mood. My hypothesis is that they are indeed very empathic during more stable or depressive episodes, and very selfish and lacking empathy in their hypomanic states. Again, if they do empathize with you, they are unlikely to weigh this empathy as greater than their *survival-related need* to do the things that are causing you pain. Which is most likely related to...\\n\\n**Hypersexuality**\\n\\nNot a symptom in the DSM-5, but present as a pattern in nearly every case that I\\'ve read here. We can break this down into two categories, sex with you and sex with other people.\\n\\n**Sex with you**: At least for me, on a daily basis I didn’t know if I was going to get a sweet and kind partner or an icy shell. This might mean rapid cycling was occurring, but I\\'m still unsure. She either wanted nothing to do with me or she would jump me when she got home from work. But even if she was icy to me in conversation, she often still wanted to have sex—even if it was a bleak disconnected sort, where she was physically present but mentally absent. You might have more sex even as the relationship is failing, but it will probably feel cheap and transactional.\\n\\nOutside of sex, you might not get too much routine intimacy. Your partner might spurn tiny affections like kisses, hugs, and casual physical touch. They may also put firm limits on the amount of time they want to spend with you.\\n\\n**Sex with other people**: They will either have an affair or *ask you for an open relationship* out of nowhere. They might tell you that they have more love to give than you can receive, so they have to spread it more widely than your relationship. They will lie outright (more common in men) or lie by omission (more common in women). This is a chicken or the egg scenario. Maybe they become hypomanic and that drops the psychological guard that we all must keep to remain faithful and committed. But I think that hypomania can by *triggered* by the chemicals and hormones that one experiences when becoming infatuated with someone new. There\\'s not much else to say here. This is usually the crux of it all, isn\\'t it?\\n\\n**Agitation**\\n\\nThey may become agitated when you try to talk with them, and especially if you bring something up about an affair. The way this plays out is very likely to be gender specific. If your partner is a woman they might display signs that they feel threatened by you when having difficult conversations. If they are a male that may be more intimidating than usual. Either way, when they are agitated or challenged about an affair is when they are most likely to say abusive or psychologically manipulative things to you.\\n\\nI am not an intimidating person. I have *never* laid a hand on any human in my entire life. I *never* raise my voice. But on two occasions my partner\\'s agitation lead to her feeling threatened and asking me for physical space, even though we weren\\'t very close in the first place. This agitation wasn\\'t constant. Some days she would come home completely exhausted and cry. On one or two occasions she asked to be held.\\n\\nOne thing that I noticed here is something like an inconsistency in opinions of others. I noticed in my ex that some days she *loved* one of her friends or family members, and then on another day she thought the same person was a jerk. This seems to match borderline personality disorder more than bipolar, but there might be an overlap. What happens in these relationship ending hypomanic moments is that their inconsistency begins to extend to you, but can be even more extreme because of the ball and chain explanation above.\\n\\n**Dependency**\\n\\nPartners of people with bipolar 2 notice longstanding patterns of dependency, even before they get any whiff of the hypomania. It is common that stable partner does all the grocery and household shopping, cooks all of the meals, plans all of the vacations, files the taxes, pays the bills, takes care of the vehicles, moves all the furniture to the new house, etc., etc., etc.\\n\\nIt is unlikely that they will recognize this or give you credit for it. In their minds, especially when hypomanic, they are superstars. They didn\\'t *ask* you to do any of that, and you don\\'t notice all the work that they do around the house. And you know what? In their minds, *you\\'re not meeting their needs* (because their need is to have an affair, or have sex three times a day, or have a partner that is OK with them being out every night and receiving no attention). \\n\\nYou want to be around them? You want to work on the marriage? Of course you do because *you are the one that is co-dependent*. I\\'ve see this over and over on the subreddit. You see, in their minds you should be able to live without them (you can). In their minds, they should be able to pursue their truth and you shouldn\\'t hold them back.\\n\\nDon\\'t buy any of this. You\\'re not co-dependent. You\\'re a stable, loving partner that is trying to fulfil your end of the sickness and health vow. Don\\'t take on the blame. Even if you\\'re not perfect (you\\'re not). Maybe you deal with depression, maybe you\\'re constantly anxious because your partner is threatening to leave you. Maybe you work too much because you feel you have to be the provider of stability because you have kids or a mortgage. Don\\'t let them weaponize anything against you. You can grow by recognizing your flaws, but if you\\'ve stuck with them until they went outside of the bounds of your unwritten marital contract, *it\\'s not your fault.*\\n\\nYou\\'re not co-dependent. They are. And if they cross a line, like asking for a divorce, having an affair, spending all your money, or going missing for awhile...You\\'re the one that will have to file the divorce papers.', 'Flair': 'Advice to Give'}, 'Post 2': {'Title': 'Struggling to accept that I should never have kids.

I will try to bring it back on point regularly*)\\n\\n35M. Late Dx ASD and ADHD.\\n\\nI grew up with this idea of what my life *should* be like but I burned out badly in highschool and many times more in my 20s. I grew up in a broken household. My mother committed suicide in front of me when I was a baby. Even as a baby, the effects of that would change me forever. There\\'s layers and layers of trauma in my formative years including all the usual ones an undiagnosed autistic and ADHD child would gain. My dad was an emotionally neglectful dictator, but he did his best and was generally liked by people around him. They called him *genuine* in his personality. But there was a LOT left lacking in his parenting style. Growing up, I had too many opportunities to say \"When I have kids I\\'ll never treat them this way.\"\\n\\nI\\'m the last living member in what was once a clan of extended family. I have half-siblings from my mother, but there\\'s no further depth to that side of the tree. She was an orphan who escaped East Germany with her aunt before the wall went up. She landed in this country and was on her own ever since. She left the aunt and set out on her own as a young teen. Everything I know about my extended family comes from my dad\\'s side.\\n\\nI feel pressured by this idea that I have to carry on the name, the legacy. I grew up with stories of the separate families, all belonging to this same clan coming together. Cousins growing up together as best friends, raucous parties, heritage, family histories and tree knowledge. Paternalism put a lot of pressure on me to carry on as one of the last remaining threads of that.\\n\\nI grew up hearing \"when you have kids...\" I figured it would just happen on it\\'s own but I was sold a barrel of lies about what life should be. Work a job, buy a car, get a mortgage, buy a house with a white picket fence.\\n\\nI was barely functional from the age of about 13, already layered in trauma, pressures and stress mounting. Failing grades, held back a year, skipping weeks and weeks of school, showing up in body but the mind is spiralling in a pit of dysfunction and depression. I had no friends, couldn\\'t socialize, hated hated hated everyone and everything. Somehow I got into a technical school and graduated with an IT diploma. PC gaming was my only escape from the [gauntlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_the_gauntlet) of life.\\n\\nI\\'m pretty sure ASD runs in the family, and my paternal grandmother\\'s side of the clan was always noted for being particularly *weird* in a clan full of weirdos. I never knew my mother, but everything I have heard screams ADHD. I\\'m the first time either ADHD or ASD were diagnosed. My half-siblings from her also have similar traits but they grew up before any of that was diagnosed.\\n\\nAfter Dx, tried a few meds and ended up recently on 40mg Vyvanse. God I wish I had this years ago. I was diagnosed just after dad died 5 years ago. I never got to talk to him about any of it. Since the Dx, and being freed from his domineering shadow, I\\'ve actually started making progress in my life. But the progress is slow. I\\'m only now dealing with trauma that\\'s 30 years old by this point. I managed to sell the house and move but it took 5 years so get through his ***hoarding***. He was a hoarder, but not a terribly bad one. That house was a black pit of emotional and financial despair.\\n\\nI\\'ve had a lot of trouble holding down a job but I think it\\'s getting better now thanks to meds, therapy, diagnosis, and finally getting out of that old house. Maybe in 10 years I might be in a place where I could mentally and emotionally be ready to properly raise a child, but then I\\'ll be old and physically incapable. The nihilistic side of me always knew I never would have kids.\\n\\nSince the Dx, I\\'ve had other thoughts. Do I want to burden a child with the same problems I\\'ve had? I can barely afford to keep myself fed, let alone care for a dependant. I can\\'t save for retirement nevermind save for a college fund. I have meltdowns, I need alone time, I have sensory overload problems, I need reset days, I need sound sleep. I know that having a child would destroy my mental and physical health. I know I\\'d just spiral again, push people away reflexively. Then I know I\\'d be destroyed by my guilt over being such a failure to the most important person in the world, my own child. Will the world even still be standing in a couple decades? Climate change is past the tipping point and is about to plunge off the deep end. Scientists speculate that entire nations will be under ocean in just 20 years and civilization is going to face a massive upset.\\n\\n3 years ago I was still somewhat optimistic about humanity and the future. Now fascism is on the rise and getting worse. Politicians are universally ripping out the social safety net, legitimizing hate crimes, destroying our rights, safety, privacy, and the planet. I don\\'t want to raise a child in this world.\\n\\nI finally I met someone. She\\'s become my best friend and partner. We want to merge our lives together. We\\'re taking things slow and communicate every step of the way. Due to medical concerns, she should not/cannot carry children and I want to say that this is not a deal-breaker for me. I understand fully and love her so much. I could never live with myself if she died from complications. The only thing more frightening than her leaving me that way is her leaving me with a child that I have to raise alone... just like my mother left my dad. (I have abandonment issues quite clearly). If anything, those complications on her side make this \"coming to grips\" process a little bit easier for me. We\\'ve already talked about what we would do if there was an oopsie. I live in fear of what happens if a child did appear, medically, emotionally, mentally, everything.\\n\\nI guess... There\\'s a part of me that doesn\\'t want to let go of the idea of having kids, but I have a mountain of reasons not to. I\\'ve plenty of stories from ADHD people whos lives and disability got so much worse when a child came into the relationship. Marriages fell  apart, lives destroyed, and depression compounded. I don\\'t think I can survive that, literally speaking. My 3rd biggest fear is failing my child whether or not my partner is still around.\\n\\nI feel like I already missed the boat on having a kid. I don\\'t want to be a geriatric parent.\\n\\n**So, lets wrap this up:**\\n\\n**I\\'m thinking of getting a Vasectomy** but I\\'m on the fence. I don\\'t know if it\\'s what I want to do yet. One small request you reader, hold your comments about how it\\'s reversible.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure I even want kids or if it was just something instilled into me when I was young just like religion was. I only discovered a world outside of religious dogma when I was 20. I learned what ADHD and ASD was at 30, and learned that my entire life was bullshit. I\\'m better but still hardly functioning or holding down a job at 35. I\\'m smart as hell but so bloody stupid in all the ways that matter. I couldn\\'t pay for, care for, educate, or adequately raise a child in a world that already looks poised to implode.\\n\\nI don\\'t want kids, yet I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s something I\\'ll regret when I\\'m on my deathbed. I know what I want is a fantasy that I\\'d never achieve even if I did have offspring. The connection I feel with my partner is more important than the feelings I have around children. I don\\'t want to and won\\'t leave her for the simple reason that she can\\'t carry them. I\\'ll never again find someone I\\'m so compatible with. It took me years of searching to find her and I\\'m not going to toss her away out of some selfish thought that \"I could do better\". She\\'s precious to me and we have fought together against fate when it has tried to keep us apart.\\n\\nI use condoms to keep both of us safe, but I might as well rub lidocaine all over my dick for how much I can feel anything. I am already somewhat desensitized from a bad childhood circumcision but even the thinnest condoms make it so I feel next to nothing. ADHD creates problems around staying aroused enough to begin, and the condom makes it hard to finish... I\\'m ending up with some unsatisfying sex. It\\'s never been her problem, or my feelings towards her. Sometimes just her smile make me hard as a rock so it\\'s not attraction or mechanical problems. Sometimes even just slapping the condom on makes the little guy go down. The vasectomy would free her and I from a lot of sexual anxiety. I\\'m holding onto this idea that a vasectomy would allow me to ditch the condoms, go bareback. If I could do that, then how much would that help solve the issue of my little guy deflating in the middle?\\n\\nWhat is it that I\\'m holding onto? Is it the idea that I want to teach someone skills that helped me survive? No, those were terrible skills. Maybe I want to teach someone the better ones I learned later in life? Do I just want kids to prove I\\'d be better than my dad? That\\'s not a great reason. Maybe what I\\'m lacking in life isn\\'t children but something else? Maybe the idea of children is a misleading need for some other type of fulfillment?\\n\\nMaybe I need someone to help me decide to go through with the vasectomy. She and I have talked about it a little bit but she wants me to make the decision for myself and my own reasons. I love that she gives me the space to figure my shit out. I don\\'t want to burden her with all the chaos in my mind when trying to sort out my feelings. Maybe anonymous others have been in a similar situation? So here we are, posting semi-anonymously on reddit.\\n\\n**TLDR**\\nComing to grips with the difference between the fantasy I was raised to believe in and how real life actually works out.

I felt the symptoms of ADHD following a long bout of working from home during COVID. \\n\\nEarlier in my life, I had never really felt the effects of ADHD; I was able to concentrate at will (comparatively anyways), so much so that I achieved excellent grades at high school/college etc\\n\\nWhen I look back, I ask myself what changed in terms of behaviour etc.; between the time I could concentrate at will and when I got diagnosed, I boiled it down to these specific behaviours:\\n\\n* Started vaping constantly \\n* Increased smartphone use\\n\\nBoth of these behaviours were massively accelerated by working from home.\\n\\nAs you all will know, these behaviours release tonnes of dopamine in the short term but have a detrimental effect in the long term on your baseline dopamine levels, &amp; research shows your baseline dopamine levels are what determines your ability to focus &amp; stay motivated, which explains why my ability to focus has decreased over time.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Experiment:**\\n\\nHypothesis:  I believe that by reducing stimuli from my environment (smartphone, vape etc), I can reduce the effects of ADHD symptoms to the point where I don't need medication to focus/stay attentive. To prove/disprove the above, for the next 90 days, I will abstain from certain dopamine-releasing behaviours, items &amp; substances ( I will list below). In addition, I will add certain behaviours to my routine that are proven to increase baseline dopamine levels.\\n\\nWhat I will be abstaining from:\\n\\n* Smartphone + smart devices, I have replaced my phone with a Nokia.\\n* All social media, even Reddit. I will ask a friend to upload on my behalf\\n* All stimulants, including Elvanse, Caffeine, Nicotine etc\\n* Porn/masturbation\\n* Audio/Visual media - restricted to books\\n* Junk food + Sugary drinks\\n* Viewing light between 10pm - 4am\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat I will be adding to my routine:\\n\\n* Minimum of 40mins exercise per day (Squash 3 days + Hypotrophy training 4 days)\\n* View sunlight in the morning\\n* The practice of internalising dopamine rewards by telling yourself you are working towards a goal\\n* Possibly more, I'll update as I go along\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo objectively measure the results, I will be taking tests that measure Executive Functions:\\n\\n* Attention - Test Of Variables of Attentions (TOVA)\\n* Inhibitory Control - Stroop\\n* Working Memory \\n   * Spatial - Corsi Block\\n   * Auditory - Digit Span\\n   * Visual - Digit Span\\n* Mental Flexibility - WCST\\n\\nAll these tests have been downloaded from the millisecond website &amp;

We deal with a lot daily. I have an 88 year old grandmother. She had 3 kids - now in their 50\\'s and early 60\\'s, themselves. When they were young, she was a very unstable and unfit mother. How she even managed to get them raised is beyond me. Made very poor decisions, was financially unstable, wouldn\\'t hold jobs for long and moved her kids around constantly from apartment to apartment trying to skip out on the rent because she \"couldn\\'t work and watch the kids\" as an excuse. The kids had a horrible childhood, frequently changed schools, etc. She seems to have lacked common sense for all of her life and made the \"wrong\" choice at every turn in life. None of us are perfect and we all make lots of mistakes. Hers are...different. I\\'m talking 30-40+ years of, \"how in the world did you mess up *every single one* of those things?\" kind of different. From big things in life to the smallest tasks that even a child single digits in age completes daily without a thought. She\\'d go to a car lot in her young years decades ago, get a car and when it needed maintenance, she\\'d \\'return\\' it and get another car. Just the same revolving pattern of \\'giving up\\' on something when it required the slightest effort, though or planning. Never owned her own house. Never saved for retirement. Ended up on SSI/Disability in her 60\\'s and complains a lot. She hates everyone on TV, sits around hurling lies at people, claims our neighbors are all \\'street bums and gay guys\\' basically living in houses for free. She says the same about politicans, the president, etc. She didn\\'t have enough work credits by retirement age. As a result of Disability (Phlebitis), she does get Medicaid and Medicare and therefore has no idea what accountability for bills and such are. She is highly unthankful for paid doctor visits and sits around berating doctors because she doesn\\'t think they\\'re fixing her medical issues. She thinks she has physical issues, but they appear to be vastly mental issues, instead. She seems completely aware of her own body\\'s actions a lot of the time.\\n\\nDecades ago, some type of psychologist or psychiatrist diagnosed my grandmother as paranoid schizophrenic with high anxiety. She wouldn\\'t take the medication, of course. So she has delusions of a former male neighbor from decades ago who has speakers/mics set up all over the neighborhood. She hears him playing all sorts of \\'tapes\\' of people dying, loud music, he says sexual stuff, mean things about her and family, etc. She once called the bomb squad to the house next door, claiming someone in the attic said a bomb would go off in 15 minutes. Police refused to take her for a mental evaluation. She described an \"awful crackling\" upon opening the back door and insisted that \"something was about to blow up\" and it was literally raining hard outside and hitting the neighbor\\'s gutters next door. We thought she had a stroke or something at first.\\n\\nShe did a lot of odd jobs earlier in life that were unproductive...e.g. in her 60\\'s, she wanted to take a push mower around in her car trunk mowing random lawns for $10 or $15 for probably 10-15 years for cash. Before that, she played around as a taxi driver for years, barely making any money from it. At one point she was training in nursing-related stuff in her younger years and quit because she claimed they told her that she\\'d get \\'AIDS\\' from it. She spent decades running from paying that bill owed after she quit the course. She did a lot of one-on-one house sitting jobs for elderly people, but I honestly don\\'t think she could even take care of herself. They\\'d complain that the dishes she washed were greasy/dirty, cups weren\\'t clean, simple meals were wrong, etc. She has lived with her daughter for the last 30+ years and the daughter (my mother) and grandson (myself) have been taking care of her. She is an absolute handful. We do what we can, but it is maddening sometimes and I\\'m not sure if this is something else on top of the schizophrenia. Quite frankly, having heard my grandmother\\'s bonkers stories from her childhood, she was a very odd and possibly extremely slow child.\\n\\nToday, she isn\\'t able to function much, has odd mannerisms, is a chronic liar and makes up stuff constantly about other people/family, thinks women are \\'gay men dressed up like women\\' and all sorts of odd stuff. We do all household tasks, cooking, etc., so she is not expected to do any chores. She\\'ll try to do them (of course wrong) and we pick up behind her. Even opening a simple package of something, she\\'ll open it the wrong way and bring it to us and claim that nobody ever showed her how to open things.\\n\\nBorn in 1934, but doesn\\'t know how finances or the world work, how inflation works, thinks prices will stay the same for 50 years, doesn\\'t know how vehicles work, what they cost to maintain, what it costs to live nowadays, how basic things like the TV or microwave work and such. So naturally she grudges paying her daughter $300/month to help with the mortgage and the daughter buys and does everything for her. She\\'s so unthankful that it\\'s not funny. My grandmother is very hard to get along with daily. It\\'s like having a devil in the other room who is roiling daily with just pure hatred. She just wants to argue all of the time and wants to run from window to window throughout the house looking out hundreds of times per day and wiping off a window that isn\\'t dirty. In the process, tearing off a paper towel each time and causing massive waste daily. Opening curtains and blinds when it is pitch black outside at 4 and 5am. Even going to the bathroom, she wants to sit with the door halfway open and the light off in the dark, so we always have to figure out if she\\'s in there or not. The daughter says my grandmother does the same thing in public stalls. Every room that you start in, she\\'s either in there already as part of the pacing back and forth or she hears you go in that room (kitchen, bathroom) and will literally get up and go rushing in there. She might sit on the couch for an hour watching TV and if she hears you go in the bathroom, she\\'ll get up running claiming she\\'s about to pee her pants and do the, \"Hurry!\" thing. She does the same thing at night, too.\\n\\nDuring the day and night, she\\'ll be peeping around the corner trying to \"see what we\\'re doing in our room\" and such. By far, my grandmother is one of the most odd and mentally \"gone\" people I have ever met; and I have come across some very mentally ill people in my lifetime in various walks of life. Her \\'nervousness\\' means she\\'ll knock cups off or not pick stuff up properly and drop it. She\\'s always shaking to pieces all of the time and claims it\\'s \\'nervousness\\'...but she wouldn\\'t take any pills that the doctor gave her. For things like knocking cups off from tables and shelves, it\\'s usually because she sat it down halfway hanging off and couldn\\'t even do that simple task properly. Things that are morally wrong and evil in life, she thinks the people that do them are good. Likewise, the people that try to do right morally and live a good life, she hates them. So she prefers her con man son (the daughter\\'s brother) and sending him extra money vs helping her daughter that does everything for her and gives her a place to live. The daughter helped that son about 20 years ago get a vehicle and he screwed her over and wouldn\\'t make the payments like he claimed. My grandmother who was living with her daughter at that time actually stood against the daughter and tried to insist that the daughter \"didn\\'t want him to enjoy it\". He runs from state to state charging up women\\'s credit with bills and flees elsewhere, but my grandmother thinks he\\'s a saint even though he has had lots of problems with the law.\\n\\nSo we don\\'t really have anywhere to \\'put\\' her as far as a mental health facility or home and her daughter doesn\\'t really want to do that or have the money to do so. They don\\'t typically take very good care of them, either. There\\'s no break from her apart from headphones, movies, walks in the park, etc. Her mannerisms are of course very odd. She is a chronic liar and anyone that she dislikes on TV, a doctor, neighbor or even in the extended family, she\\'ll make up absurd lies about them. Things like saying a man is really a woman or a woman is really a man dressed up like a woman. Her mind is pretty sick. Most older people have hobbies, friends and interests. She has none. The few people that she knew, she did something to where she doesn\\'t know them any more, including some family. Her half-sister used to call my grandmother regularly until my grandmother wrote her a letter saying her kids were \\'retarded\\' and she stopped talking to her.\\n\\nI\\'m absolutely puzzled how someone\\'s mind + delusions on top could get this incredibly bad.', 'Flair': 'Advice / Encouragement'}, 'Post 5': {'Title': 'Advice on seeking diagnose ADHD-I', 'Text': \"I've been thinking to write this here for about a week. I want to be 'positively' sure that I have ADD/ADHD-I as I am already 19 and an official diagnosis is pretty big chunk of cash. I'll try to keep this post as short as possible but with the necessary information to bias an opinion. OK, sorry, it's a long read.\\n\\nSo, my background; when I was in 1st grade, I would never pay attention to any other class expect math. I would walk around, daydream, do my own thing, check other kid's work, generally pushing the bounderies of my teacher. Because of that, I was sent to same school as my brother for kids with problems. Also, my brother recently was diagnosed with autism too.\\n\\nDuring my first year at the special school, I got tested for ASS, took like 2 months, each week a day, so pretty thorough I reckon. No ASS/autism. The first year in that school was great. I once more excelled at math and this time language too! I don't remember too much, so I'll just take notes from teacher:\\n\\n* I worked motivated on math but if I didn't understand a part I would become very demotivated and would need motivation from teacher to start again. \\n* At the end of lessons (1 lesson \\\\~50min) my focus would die down. \\n* Sometimes my work attitude/attention would be very dynamic. Mood changes, from very productive to not doing anything at all.\\n* They suspected I had failure anxiety. \\n* Daydreaming, not paying attention to the topics instead talking about something happening at home (Halloween, my new cat)\\n* Knew how to following a step-by-step plan, but usually didn't follow it\\n* I would easily talk negative of myself; low self esteem. Apparently I said that I was stupid because I couldn't read the year prior. \\n* Perfectionism. \\n* Seeking bounderies of people, sometimes a bit too far. Seeking out a single person to test their bounderies. If teacher corrected me, I would either genuinely see my mistake and apologize or try to talk my way out of it; seeking thrill\\n* Independent\\n* Impatience. I would interrupt people if it took to long for me / couldn't wait til it was my turn to talk.\\n\\nI went on to 4th grade after my 1st grade. But then I really got bored and because the student guidance never reached out again to move back to a normal school, I stayed there til I went to high school. I never was a perfect student from 4-6th grade. Here's some of common commentary on my reports, much of it the same as 1st grade;\\n\\n* No motivation / low attentionspan expect if it interested me (Math, French, PC, ect).\\n* Dynamic persistence, sometimes good, sometimes very weak.\\n* Spoken boredom; I would openly say that if I found something boring, that it was boring (lack of motivation, no interest)\\n* Fear of failure, low self esteem\\n* Systematically follow a plan, sometimes very hard if not interested (lack of attention)\\n* Would sometimes work unenthusiastic, just do it to be done with it.\\n\\nThe last year of elementary school, I started skipping school. Next school year, I went to high school but ended up in the 'job market' part. Wanted to do STEM, but I couldn't because I came from special needs school. Stopped going after three weeks all together because no interest and I had fear of the machinery that they would break or operating error and I'd lose my hand (overthinking). Because I skipped school so much, I had to be placed under juvile support and went to the same highschool as my autistic brother because I wanted to do 'nothing' in school, this in combination with a boarding school. Changed back to normal high school on fake promise, then went into depression and then to even worse school and stopped going the second I turned 18.\\n\\nHere comes the weird part, that boarding school had it's own psychologist(s) and she diagnosed me with autism. No questionaire for me nor my parents. Never did any sort of tests. Didn't even knew it til they told me it after like half a year. I don't see myself as having ASS, that's the problem. I have three brothers with autism. My mother says I'm not autistic and she has 3 sons with autism. My sister cannot, my brother in law cannot. Teachers have told me I am not autistic at all. It's a wrong diagnosis and kinda scummy.\\n\\nAnyway, since I left the boarding school, I haven't done much. I'd think that boarding school definitely supressed some of my symptoms because they would literally knock me out of the bed. But I'd have had most of these for my whole life. Still want to get my high school degree and start at university though. I have the materials to study and I've done 6 exams in 14 months and passed them all but I've maybe studied enough to fill 3 days (about 25 hours). I procrastinate til the evening before the planned exam. It has worked so far for geology, history, English (two exams), Dutch (two exams), but it won't work for exams like maths, physics, biology, chemistry, I need to catch up to years. So, I've done nothing for my exams since february 2022. There's just always something that pops into my head. I have no job, I have time. I just keep procastinating and procastinating. I don't even know why. Sciences and math interest the hell out of me. It's like there's something holding me back but I don't know what, like an invisible force field.  And it's been since february, I have no time sense, like that time blew past me. I have issues setting priorities too. \\n\\nI'm starting rambling as it's pretty late but I'll just quickly put all my symptoms down here with bit of info. That will be my TDLR too but without background info.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTDLR;\\n\\nSummary of symptoms:\\n\\n* Difficulties starting a (advance/hard) task: exams for example. Or filling in documents for my parents, I always postpone it.\\n* Difficulty to plan or to stick to a plan (as in daily routine, it'll always change a bit how i am feeling, ect)\\n* Mood swings: I'd think I have issue with this too. Sometimes I'm really open but sometimes you just gotta leave me alone.\\n* Procrastinating: I don't even really know why I do this? Is that weird? I am just lazy? For example; I am interested in sciences and have a talent for it, but I cannot make myself do it.\\n* Attention: When I studied for geology, I would always switch to lots of other things. I do this all the time, even when casually I just do lot of things or wander off. Same for exams, I start with 1st question but quickly go to the 24th question. I go over it unstructured and lose time by doing it.\\n* Forgetfulness: Sometimes chaotic like that I lose an item I just put down or when going out for cycling I forget where I put my keys, I forget stuff a lot that it becomes an annoyance. But I'd find them easily because I have only like 3-4 spots for an item where I could have laid them\\n* Hard time expressing feelings\\n* Lack/weak sense of time: I have been procrastinating my studies since february. I don't know why.\\n* Sleep: I could sleep 8 hours and wake up, turn myself, and sleep another 5 hours (13 hours total) and wake up being tired for first few hours. I could also sleep for only 5 hours and get energy like crazy at night and be awake for 20-22 hours or so and than fall asleep and sleep 12 hours (like two days ago). So weird, my sleeping has always been bad. I always go to bed deep in the night and sleep at like 1-2 AM, unless really really really tired.\\n* Low self esteem\\n* Indecisiveness; example; just recently. Spend hours and in total weeks deciding between iPhone 13 or Galaxy S22. Tested these devices in store for hours and than hours of just staring at specs and popping up with 'does x work on ...', 'battery issues x..'. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I'd say I spent 40-50 hours straight deciding between them. I did make a choice, but I'm still not sure!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, yeah, that's about it... Does this look like it might be ADHD-I? Or I am just an extremely lazy loser in denial looking for excuses, even though, I really do/want (to) try getting my life better. \\n\\nIf you have any more questions for me to answer to get better opinion, just let me know. I'd really want to be sure before going as it'll be a 'waste' of money.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBTW. When writing this, I actually got my old school reports to help me a bit with the history but I also found my brother's diagnoses with ASS and than I organized all reports by name but not by year coz it's quite late, so I got distracted again. I'm 1 and half hours later now from when I started writing the post. Oh, and it totally didn't take me in total 5 hours with all distractions to write and post this. I even thought of not posting it like 30 times\", 'Flair': 'Questions/Advice/Support'}}, 'advice needed': {'Post 1': {'Title': \"Likely BPD friend reported me to HR and shut me out...and it wasn't exactly the first time (longish post with bullet points and story)\", 'Text': 'Just coming off the second go-around of a hard situation with a coworker/very good friend who likely has BPD. Really hurting but after learning about BPD, I think person has it (and possibly has some handle on it), and it\\'s making me feel better to think that\\'s what this is...when I read the signs and other info, it was like when you watch a thriller and at the end you have the big reveal that makes things make sense. I guess this is the tenor of my post, kind of decompressing/debriefing and looking for support. I\\'ve been on eggshells for about two years with this person being hot and cold with me and wondering what I\\'ve been doing wrong--or could do wrong next.\\n\\nI\\'m italicizing some things below as they come back in play later at the end.\\n\\nHere are things/signs the person told me over the last three years--not asking for a Dx just again decompressing.\\n\\n* They \"feel emotions very strongly/deeply\"\\n* Seem very mature even on psychology but reacts in immature ways\\n* Another female colleague thought this person was probably \"bipolar\"\\n* Moved around a lot as a child through teen due to father\\'s religious vocation, which she shared also added stress because you can\\'t step a toe out of line in that situation \"or you\\'ll get nailed to the wall\"\\n* Specifically admitted \"anger is their worst trait\" (although I never actually saw them angry verbally)\\n* They want to \"keep work life work, and personal life separate\" because \"boundaries are healthy for me\"\\n* \"I know I seem like I\\'m a person who has it all together...but really I don\\'t.\"\\n* Whenever they would do a personality test, they claimed they were right in the middle and would shift around a lot\\n* They admittedly have few real, deep friends (despite being the life of the party)\\n* Does not like help and will push against it--although if she *does* ask for it, the next day she may reject it\\n* \"Doesn\\'t always communicate what they need\" and would frequently say she \"needs space\" after a tough situation\\n* They hate comparisons (even positive ones, say they \"kill joy\")\\n* Either impulsive, or \"reverse impulsive\"--getting into a situation quickly, and/or slowly then suddenly backing out for no reason (but does admit that she moves too quickly)\\n* Will say critical things about others, when they had done the same thing\\n* ...and ironically admitted their philosophy of \"what people say about others is what they\\'re most concerned of themselves\"\\n* Foot in mouth a lot\\n* Flirty, although I mostly noticed it with me\\n* When very busy at work or have a lot of mentally taxing things go on, visibly seems tired the next day\\n* Has mentioned trouble sleeping\\n* Has told other colleagues that they \"just can\\'t imagine themselves\" regarding their future\\n* Can\\'t handle change well\\n* Gets \"tunnel vision\" in regards to their focus on a project/task\\n* Doesn\\'t take responsibility well and will usually blame the other person, and/or make half apologizing pointing to other person\\'s faults (for example, says they crave autonomy as a supervisor, but is known to micromanage and control team\\'s ability to contact others without going through her)\\n\\nThree years ago I, a married guy, had a single female colleague who began to buddy up to me and then eventually contacted me to learn about my job at my company so that she could replace me.\\n\\nIn my workplace people had a sense of family and getting to know each other with varying degrees of intimacy. This person, who seemed a really good person, life of the party, everyone loves her sort of deal, I soon learned sternly kept work as work, personal as personal. Literally wouldn\\'t tell you what they did over the weekend. I had never met anyone like that in our office so respected it. However, we slowly developed a friendship. I did notice many signs of perhaps feelings or affections for me, as did my wife, but not in a way that either of us were uncomfortable. Just thought it was kind of cute and harmless sort of deal. Regardless, both my wife and I thought this girl was an absolute gem and could not believe this person was single and even tried to set her up with a couple of guys we knew--although sometimes things the girl would say or do would just not make sense with my wife and she always thought the friend had some sort of problem.  (Girl in question did tell me that she had gotten out of a relationship that ended \"very very badly\"). That said, we clicked on a lot of things, saw things similarly, and would even finish each other\\'s sentences or introduce a similar thought at the same time which made working professionally great.\\n\\nDuring COVID and work from home we communicated more during work and sometimes outside of work via text message (want to be clear this was not heavy texting--a couple quick conversations per week. Not daily. Nothing my wife was uncomfortable with regarding the content. My wife liked this person, and I never had intentions with this person). Once, I needed to bring something to this person\\'s house (to which I had been once before), and they had accidentally deleted a personal project on their laptop and was so despondent that they refused to even answer the door, which I thought was really odd. **(extreme emotion/can\\'t handle emotion?)**\\n\\nThis friend became more open to me about personal life, but not anything too crazy. My wife did say several times she thought the girl was flirting with me or had a crush, but again in a \"that\\'s cute\" way. However this person began texting me more about random life things.\\n\\nWe had a change at work and the friend cried that they couldn\\'t work with me anymore, but nothing dramatic here. *However, our boss said she could set it up where we did so on projects since we worked well together. She was all for it. Then, come the day when the change took place, she lashed out at me for contacting her and refused to work with me and said she didn\\'t want to do the plan*. Our big boss had to step in and say she still needed to collaborate for certain things.  **(signs of impulsive/inconstancy?)** That caused a rift, but we figured it out. Friend then comes to me a month later (late 2020) and apologizes, says she wants to be friends, sorry if she hurt me etc. I was surprised as I was over it and we had been acting as friends still for months **(abandonment stuff?)**\\n\\nEarly 2021 something happens and she snaps at me on a work call. I don\\'t engage her much for a week, then I check with her and mention I haven\\'t talked much and wanted to see if she was ok. She says she has stuff going on in her life and apologies for hurting me, and asks if I\\'ve been through this with anyone before. I said yes, many years ago before marriage I had a female friend do something similar--which I had no romantic interest in. The girl got really mad and asked her to not ask me about her personal life any more and to give her some space. A week later I checked in on her. I was really concerned about her. I asked if she was taking to her friends about her problem and if that she was taking care of her mental health **(oops in retrospect)** and she got really mad, told me to leave her alone, was going to talk to my boss, etc. I was so shocked and hurt--this was not something off limits etc.\\n\\nThat night, she texts me saying we are friends and want to be on the same page. We talk the next day; she blames me that I have a \"different definition of friendship\" than her **(gaslighting or similar?)** and doesn\\'t want to share \"intimate, soul-touching\" things with me. I did not believe we did that, just good friends. On the other hand, she said that she would talk about me \"all the time\" when home for a month on vacation and that her parents would ask \"ohhh so who\\'s this guy?\" She apologized if she hurt me and we ended any personal contact. That said, she would not work with me professionally and would get angry if I got into her work and she would lie about things, etc.--even though I myself was tasked to work with her. However, at times she would come to me and ask me advice, only to pull away and shut me out the next day if I offered further advice. **(inconstancy?)** This was very stressful on me because I didn\\'t know how to interact and didn\\'t want to get in trouble with my career advancement, and/or reported to HR.\\n\\nBegin fast forwarding. Personal side mends. We talk on work communications and also slowly again on the personal side via texts, but it is more pared down. Couple random conversations a month, lasting a handful of texts. Nothing drawn out. Nothing inappropriate, even according to my wife. However, from then on I\\'m always stressed when talking with her. It\\'s like she has power over me. Is she going to hurt me again? Is she going to imply she doesn\\'t want to work with me and that I\\'m no good at my job? etc.\\n\\nFriend goes for a different job in the company. She gets the job, but negotiates a higher pay. Pushes for several higher ups to approve. They do, only for her to back down. **(more implusive or trying to escape a situation?)** She gets in trouble and has to write a bunch of apology letters to higher ups.\\n\\nLater she gets knocked in her annual review for not working with me when required and brings up the personal side. I learned that she claims she didn\\'t want people thinking we were having an affair **(???)**, and that she would give me little nuggets of attention so I wouldn\\'t think she was cold-hearted. Boss tells her that the personal stuff interfered with professional stuff and that was why. She gets quiet on me for a couple of weeks, but things heal again. Soon thereafter she decides to move back home to a different state. Shares Zillow with me etc.\\n\\nWe continue to work well together and the friendship is very solid  with the proper boundaries. Maybe a quick text conversation or two per month, maybe none. However, we will talk about personal stuff at work during a call if there is time. She may send me pictures of home projects/hobbies, etc. as part of a short conversation. *She offers to read a book I wrote.*\\n\\nThis summer we attend a corporate event. She gets really, very chatty with me while flying in, via text. Asks when I\\'m getting in. Sits next to me at dinner. Texts me the next morning asking me to come down when no one else is there. Texts me that evening to meet her and walk with her to corporate event. Doesn\\'t eat and drinks too much and gets drunk **(impulsiveness?)**. *I bring her electrolytes and leave on her doorstep which she thanks me for and uses and thanks me for again in the middle of the night*. She texts me later asking me if I\\'ve made it home etc.\\n\\nAt this point she seems to share a lot and want to talk to me more. Nothing over the line though. *Later goes on a trip out of the country. We talk about it, and I ask to see pictures. She sends me a picture of herself in short shorts that I am uncomfortable with.* Soon more pictures follow, with food, scenery, more of just her, etc. It is not the first time she sent me a picture of herself when I didn\\'t ask for it (for example, wanted to share a pic of her new dog and it was her *with* the new dog, in short shorts, etc). I also notice that since being back from her trip, she is dressing more fancy and doing make-up--she has always dressed nice and feminine but this is even more so and I\\'m thinking, what changed for her to suddenly be this way **(something shifted her identity after spending over a week out of the country with a friend?)**\\n\\nI get conflicted with some of this and also feel bad about the professional and personal falling out from years before (I\\'m a typically \"nice guy\"). We also butt heads during work sometimes, so I bring this all up. I mention to her that I am sorry about the personal stuff, I have always felt guilt about it, apologized if we had gotten to a point where we had feelings for each other or something, or if I had conveyed that I did inadvertently (I don\\'t believe I actually did because I never thought about being with this person or leaving my wife or anything sexual, I\\'m just trying to understand all the things I had learned about what she said, or told my boss during her annual review, and thought maybe somehow I had allowed myself to have these feelings without recognizing and caused an issue). She said she didn\\'t but that \"we clicked on a lot of things and she really enjoyed our companionship\". I agreed maybe that\\'s what it was, I just took it so hard and felt guilty. She shared some difficulties in her personal life (roommate suicide attempts) which caused problems for her back then. She was really gracious about everything and told me not to worry, it was all good, etc.\\n\\nNext day she applies for a different job--*and asks me for a letter of recommendation.* I\\'m happy for her and agree to do it--although I do question that there is a strict requirement she can\\'t meet. Anyway, we talk normally for two days, joking, working on the letter. She asks me for coaching on getting ready for the interview, takes a lot of notes. **Then suddenly she says she can\\'t talk about the interview and think about it as it\\'s too far away. (??? she asked me to talk about it...)** Regardless, all is well. Next day she tells me she can\\'t go for the job because of the strict requirement **(impulsiveness/pulling out impulse?)** and won\\'t really talk, although interacts with me normally via email. I believe it is her just shutting down and leaving her be.\\n\\nThe next week she begins cancelling meetings with me, rejecting special projects, etc. Then I got brought into HR. I was accused of crossing boundaries regarding asking about her personal life when she told me not to, and having an unconfomrtable and innappropriate relationship, specifically via text messages. I was floored. She mentioned that I gave her a copy of my book. That I went to her hotel room. That me trying to work with her after our job changes back in the day was bad. Several other things which she had consented to and/or initiated in the past. *It\\'s like all the things I mentioned above were misremembered as me with bad intent or being unwelcomed!!!* I answered my statement truthfully and explained I had screenshots of our text conversation I could send. They seemed surprised that I had evidence and were eager for me to send it--especially about the vacation pictures and the electrolytes at our corporate event. They saw the content and that she initiated and welcomed conversations with me and shared things about her personal life. Come the following week, I was completely exonerated, but can no longer contact this person for anything but work.\\n\\nThis was VERY hard. It is the second time this person had done this to me and I really thought they were different. Not only that, they tried to get me fired. I believe they told my boss about our conversation, who was obligated to go to HR--but clearly she dug in and put a negative spin on a lot of things which I easily proved were false. My wife read my entire 3-year text message conversation (again just want to convey it was in fits and spurts and not a constant, secret conversation) and was not bothered by anything I said to this person as it was all platonic.\\n\\nThe following day the person began lashing out to me via work emails--I was 100% in the right and my boss asked me to begin copying them on emails to keep both of us safe (I believe, based on other things my male boss has said, to keep me safe, and to keep her from getting in trouble by going through the same patterns that got her in trouble on her annual review the last time).\\n\\nI had my first call with this person last week. They kind of acted like they were testing the waters \"hey...how\\'s it goin...?\" (I recorded the conversation for my safety and my wife listened to it and agreed). I unknowingly was a gray rock, mostly because I was just so nervous and anxious to deal with the person. I didn\\'t engage her but the bare minimum. The next day, the person views my LinkedIn profile, removes me as a connection, then posts this big, peppy post about how much she loves the company and her position (I only saw this because our 100+ connections in common liked it and it showed up in my feed). I thought this as SO bizarre--especially because a few weeks earlier she told me she was struggling and wanted that new job. **(strong discarding here because I gray rocked?)**\\n\\nThat said, in another conversation, the person brought me back in and asked me to mentor them and give them advice on a new team member they are getting. Then shut down on a separate call. **(same pattern as early 2021, the back and forth)**. Very confusing and difficult.\\n\\nWhat really tipped me off to all of this and that it\\'s probably cyclical is that we met a guy at the recent corporate event who was really nice. Also a married guy. We don\\'t work with him though, and we WFH so we don\\'t see him. However, she engages him or calls his name out in work chats when there is a large interdepartmental training call, and has invited him to be a guest speaker at a team meeting in March (it\\'s only November...and this person is not a big player by any means to be a suitable guest speaker). It\\'s like she\\'s rebounding and starting a new cycle with another person.\\n\\nAlso on a bigger team meeting the person mentioned using Sanvello a lot lately which is an anxiety/depression app...which I thought was really weird for someone who doesn\\'t share her personal life to mention this on a call for 50+ people.\\n\\nLots of other random things I picked up on but didn\\'t understand, like I gave her evidence on something where she was mistaken during a work lunch with another person and she randomly got up and said \"well guys, gotta head out\" and left. She asked me to help her prep for a job interview and then after talking for about 10 minutes she suddenly said, \"well, we can talk about this later, the interview is so far off I\\'m just not in the headspace for it.\" Very confusing since she asked me to talk to her about it...\\n\\nIn fact, I realized that I\\'ve gone through **almost two years** of stress because this person would be so hot or cold if they wanted to talk/cooperate on work stuff or if they didn\\'t, similarly on the friendship level. Not major swings but still in so confusing ways. I was always nervous around her, at least in the back of my mind. \"When is she going to put up a wall again and/or hurt me again?\"\\n\\nAnyway, long story I know. Thank you for reading. Again, I\\'m not sure it\\'s BPD but after learning about it, it sure sounds like it. Any advice on how to cope? The second go around is not easy, again as a \"nice guy\" and someone who trusts people, to be turned on so harshly so quickly. However, I don\\'t have anything against this person and I want to make sure I stay protected while still not being mean to her or causing her to get in trouble at work, etc.\\n\\nReally appreciate the support.', 'Flair': 'Seeking Support'}, 'Post 2': {'Title': 'Somebody please help me - Im suffering and I need to leave her but I cant.', 'Text': 'I am M (23) and she uw/bpd F (26) was my first love. I was a virgin and had never had a girlfriend, despite everyone saying im good looking, I was always shy. 7 months ago I met the most beautiful girl ive ever seen on a dating app who had just moved to my city from Hong Kong 3 weeks prior with her family (9/10 in looks is fair). Immediately on our first date the vibing fireworks were crazy, we matched on so many things, discussed so much, it was like a dream, we connected on Philosophy, music, shared values, we danced into the night and we got extremely intimate very fast. \\n\\nI should have seen the warning signs. After dropping her back home, I received 2 calls and 15 messages in the morning about how she was terrified and that she shouldnt have been intimate with me as she doesnt usually do that outside a relationship, and while I was in the gym and the library studying, she accused me of seeing other girls at 11am in the morning. These were all insane red flags, but as I thought she was beautiful and we vibed so much, I assumed it was just a culture difference or something, so I reassured and we went in a second date. The fireworks continue, yet so did the arguments, 2 weeks in we had met 3 times and argued 3 times over text mainly. It was always culture differences so I didnt think much of it. She said shes extremely sensitive but I liked that because it made her deep thinking and from what ive read on here unlike most shes extremely empathetic, I mean genuinely she will feel the pain of others intensely. \\n\\nShe pressured me 3.5 weeks in saying that she couldnt see me unless we were in a relationship and that she needed that reassurance and asked whether I care about her. For me this was too soon, and again another red flag, but I thought again a culture difference, as asian culture is more conservative in regards to initmacy, and that is partly why, but now ive realised it was mainly because of her emotional insecurities that even 3 weeks into knowing someone she was emotionally unstable if that guy couldnt provide guarantees. \\n\\nMore red flags to come.\\n\\nBut also not just red flags, I would like to say unlike many, she is the sweetest girl I have ever met, she has never been intentionally abusive, she is always thinking about others, always buying gifts to my family and making an effort even tho she struggles socialising, seeing my friends, writing me love letters expressing her feelings and how ive pushed her through a depressing phase of immigration and having no jobs and no friends at this time in her life.\\n\\n1 month in she felt insecure and said she needed to know that I loved her. At that time I didnt, but a week later her pressure maybe catalysed it, but it genuinely came when I started to think about love more. Finally after 1.5 months I told her I love her, I wrote her a poem, she cried.\\n\\nRed flag - She told me that if I hadnt asked her this week she would have blocked me and not talked to me again, she said after 2 weeks she might contact me again but she couldnt handle that insecurity of not knowing as she loved me so much and i didnt love her, I checked her texts and she had told her old friend (she had not friends that ever lasted) that she would block me if I didnt say I love her as she felt insecure and thought I could still be a fuckboy (I told her im a virgin and emotionally soft).\\n\\nRed flag - She told me she has had 13 past relationships spanning multiple up to 3 years, but some just a month and they all ended because although some of the guys were toxic and some were nice, they all said they couldnt handle her emotions. I thought those guys are horrible, I can save her be there for her. This personality flaw of always wanting to help combined with love blinded me to the bigger picture. That although some of these guys were toxic, at least half, she even admitted left her because of her intense feelings, but I thought she seems so sweet, how dare they do that to her, I didnt see what she really meant. \\n\\nAs time went on she became more loving, baking me stuff, spending her small wage on me, writing love letters, we vibed talked about life, had great experience together, she spent days painting me pictures dedicated to us, which were incredible.\\n\\nBut over time it was getting me down. I spent hours and hours looking for jobs for her as it made her depressed and I was taking on that depression and those insecurities. She would cry a lot, sometimes talking about how everyone left and she didnt want me to abandon her, I thought shes so sweet and made so many promises to her. She said she was nothing, and that I gave her something. Everytime we would call at night she would talk about her day for 30 mins and then when I get excited to talk about my day she says shes too tired and needs to sleep, which was fair as she worked early in a warehouse, but then why call if its always on sided? I understood as I come from a financially privileged background and she doesnt, but over time I felt emotionally rejected. There were many times where she listened to emotions and helped me be more in touch with them, but it was always mixed. The second I question this and say I feel emotionally rejected she plays victim and talks about how hard it is for in a toxic family household, with a warehouse job and no friends, I understood and always apologised, but this always ground me down and made me feel like I was walking on eggshells, I just didnt realise at the time.\\n\\nThen came the bigger arguments, twice she created an argument out of something tiny and shouted at me and stormed away in public, disappearing. For example the first argument she stormed away because I didnt take good pictures of her and she made an effort to look good and I couldnt capture that. I went after her and comforted her. The second time it was another small thing. I comforted and went after her. I never raised me voice, I always stayed calm. Deep down I knew this was a huge issue and red flag, how could I be with someone who communicated and acted like this over small issues.\\n\\nThe third time it happened, I felt empty, numb, I felt rejected, abandoned and I didnt have the energy to go after her, I thought this isnt my fault, if she loves me she will come back to me, and she did. She apologised and she brightened up and was also happy and bought me a meal, it was like an emotional release for her, but those emotions were released onto me. I talked to her about it and said its not fair, if we are equal and then I shouldnt be running after you everytime. She thought about it and introspected and said that she agrees because she loves me and believes in equality and doesnt want me to feel rejected and that she does it because she wants to feel comfort and attention from me and know I care. I said that doesnt make sense as you know how much I care about you and love you. I always comfort you, I drive you everywhere, I paid for your stuff when you cant afford it, I spend hours everyday applying for jobs on behalf of you, I introduce to my social circle and even grandparents, I write letters, I support you emotionally and in every way and its still not enough. She said shes knows but in that moment its not logical she just needs to feel it. And she said she knows its wrong and she wont do it again.\\n\\nRed flag - She tells me that in her past she was so much worse, she smashed up apartment, tried to commit suicide and ended up in a mental hospital, cried in public and begged people to stay screaming, hurt herself. She said that shes improved so much now (which based on the past is 100% true) and that all she does is walk away from me because she needs space and feels depressed because of her situation and is too tired to hear about my day. I know shes right, that improvement is insane. I think she had major BPD in the past which apparently led her to have epilepsy seizures and religious experiences and blackouts (but she doesnt know its bpd even tho im sure it is) and now shes improved so much and so it hurts her when I make a big deal and ask her to try and change her emotions. She says I cant see the change but she tries everyday.\\n\\nNow onto the straw the broke the camels back. I felt normal, we are 6 months into a relationship, I pick her up and she told me she had a cold and my response was \"Oh you should have told me and we could have gone for a walk another day\". She was surprised and hurt and said that she was looking forward to seeing more all week and now I dont want her. We go to walk and she refuses to get out the car, I say I dont have the emotional energy for this. For me its such a little thing, I was so excited to see her as well, and I was just half joking while driving saying that I should have seen her another as im gonna get sick now, I even laughed and smiled at her cheekily as I said it. She finally gets out the car, and I feel so tired because I know this will be a repeat cycle and I cant deal with the emotional stress anymore, the stepping on eggshells, the overreactions and emotionally charged arguments. We begin walking and she says how it makes her feel, I say I understand but you cant let such small thing affect you, my mums parents are almost dying, shes struggling and I have to support her, in this situation all I said was I dont wanna get sicka and the reaction is like I just cheated on you, she says it doesnt matter, whats important is not how big the perceived issue but the way it makes someone feel, again I said I understand but you cant communicate like that throughout life and it turned into her shouting and she walked away. I felt numb, empty. I think I knew in my heart there and then that it was over, not because I couldnt love her or forgive her. But because my emotions were beyond repair. I had anxiety after 20 mins and I ran after her calling for her, these are busy roads at high speeds and she doesnt know she is, im shaking. I finally find her and we talk it out, but I just feel numb. \\n\\nThat was 9 days ago, ever since then I know longer think of her in the same way. Even though 90% of the time shes so sweet and caring, the 10% overwhelmed me so much that thinking of her and being round her started to give me anxiety and I felt a knot in my stomach. I was with her and she was being intimate but she felt like a stranger to me. Like it didnt feel natural to hold her hand, she didnt make me happy anymore just feeling weird and anxious, like the first 2 dates when I didnt really know her. \\n\\nSo I told her I needed space and time to process my emotions and that this argument and more so the repeated overeactions have overwhelmed. At first she didnt understand and text me saying that she would block me and I ruined her life by pushing her away and leaving and abandoning her. 10 Minutes later even though I need my space, I text her and say do you want to call, and she says I feel fine now, just doing some work. The quick emotional flips are insane which is what makes me thinking its BPD.\\n\\nShe can be an angel and flip just like that.\\n\\nAfter 3 days we met up and I recieved something so unexpected it broke me into tears. She apologised, she said she was wrong for walking away and making me feel abandoned and hurting me. She said she wants to change and that I have helped through so much (At this time she finally found a job and I had celebrated and cried with her 1 week prior) and that walking away is wrong and she didnt realise it made feel so deep and hurt and that I was that sensitive. \\n\\nShe said that she realises she doesnt know how to love and she doesnt know why and that all this time shes done so many things for me that shes never done before, that shes always received love but never known how to give it. She said shes never baked before, but she learnt just so she could see a smile on me and my familys face when she brings cookies to my house. She said shes never payed for guys meals, she goes out of her way to spend £5 on a box of sushi when she has £50 in her bank account, just so she can see the smile on my face. She said she knows that she doesnt know how to her love and communicate and regulate her emotions, but shes trying and she wants to try and communicate and support me in the ways I have done to her because she truly loves me.\\n\\nAfter this day I felt back to normal again, and she actually seemed changed, when she would call she would ask all about my day and my feelings, I had an interview and she said how much she supports me and how much I deserve it and that if I keep pushing then one day I will achieve it and that she will always have my back no matter what. She started asking about my emotions when we felt likr a disgareement was coming up and it was working. But then 2 days later, the feeling came back and I couldnt control it, like she was a stranger and I was anxious and didnt feel myself around her. I think i realised no matter what she says and makes positive change, I have been emotionally overwhelmed numbed and unitnetionally on her part damaged so much that I dont think I can recover. \\n\\nI genuienly think that she is trying and is changing, but its only been a week, but I cant change my feeling of fear, slight resentment and distance. The damage is done, and I dont want that damage but I cant control that regradless of whether she changes or not.\\n\\nI met her last night after a few days space and planned to go in telling her that I know she needs comfort, love and constant reassurance, but I cant provide her that even though Im still willing to be with her and love her and support her, and she has to accept that the old loving me has been pushed away by her actions, but im willing to make an effort to try and work through it, if shes willing to accept the love isnt the same anymore. \\n\\nThis led to a full mental breakdown. It was the most terrifying, heart breaking and traumatising thing I have ever seen. She started hitting herself, wailing, saying im leaving her and im like all the others, that she will be lonely again and shes not sure if she can live anymore with this crippling lonliness. She started talking about all the expectations she had, and started crying when thinking about the fact we will never have the baby we dreamed about or the apartment or the life that she craved and hoped for and that she really put every expectation on this, even introducing me to her parents within 2 months, despite her never doing it until at least a year as she finally saw me as the one. She literally fell down to my feet and begged for me not to leave her. It traumatised me but I just kept telling her its okay, your okay, breathe, youre safe and strong, please breathe for me, im always going to be here for you no matter what happens. I then held her down as she started punching her face and helped her breathe with me. \\n\\nThe one thing that scarred me is that she kept saying stuff in between. She said you are so kind, you couldnt have known this is the real me, its not your fault, im just a terrible person, im stupid and i hate myself, I shouldnt exist, I dissapoint everybody, my parents, every bf ive ever had has left me, some even cut themselves over me. Its a cycle and I cant escape, im only human. I said I want you to get some help because I care about you and her reaction was are you saying im crazy, im mentally ill, im insane is this the way youve always looked at me, i dont need help I tried already, I cant be helped, this is me.\\n\\nI couldnt break up with her. I was so emotionally traumatized. I couldnt bring myself to break a broken woman. I couldn\\'t break the woman that 95% of the time, I love so intensely for her character, actions, values and personality but the 5% is mentally breaking me.\\n\\nSo I dropped her back, went home and woke my parents up at 3am and broke down. I havent slept or eaten.\\n\\nI dont know what to do. She has no one in her life, no friends, her family dont speak to her, shes in a foreign country and she refused help.

My personal experiences with BPD and an out-reach for help.\", 'Text': '  \\n\\nHello everyone! I have just recently ended a relationship of 2 years with a woman who’s diagnosed with BP disorder. I decided to write down the events that took place over the past 7 weeks, to not only help myself feel better but to see if anyone has any suggestions or insight on the situation. Please reach out, reply, or ask any questions. I’ve learned a lot from this situation and maybe others could learn from it as well! \\n\\nSo, I have been in a relationship with a young woman of 21, (Now 23 and for the purpose of this post (let’s call her beau), since April of 2021 who is diagnosed with Bi-Polar. Upon entering the relationship things were extreme (I wasn’t to know of her condition until 6 months in). We would have sudden fights, but also great moments of happiness as well. Unknown until a year later, she had just gotten out of a month long in-house mental care facility due to an extreme manic episode, (that was escalated by use of psychedelics), that caused her to crash her vehicle into a tree on a highway median due to hallucinations. I found out about this around October 2021 and it took till January 2022 when an end of relationship all hell broke loose, and I left her. She asked me for another chance which I accepted on conditions, that she would start taking her medication again and seek therapy once a week, that she would seize all alcohol and drug consumption (she threw in quitting vaping as well), and that we were to both put in the effort necessary to improve our lives for each other. (I quit drinking, and smoking in support). This started in late January 2022 and it was rough for months dealing with the withdrawal symptoms as well as the Bipolar symptoms (Medicine takes a while to regulate you), but we lived side by side in the same house both working from home and even though I helped her, I still give her the credit because she did it! She quit everything, started being a better partner, better daughter/sister/friend and refocused on school and landed a KILLER job on the West Coast, good ol’ Cali (worked remotely from the east coast where we lived). This was all largely possible because we had her mother\\'s immense emotional support and constant encouragement for her daughter as well as me and the relationship. \\n\\nWell, the time finally came when she had to move out to California and wanted me to come with. We had a lot of back and forth but ultimately, I moved out with her in early July and started getting our lives underway! Things were rocky as anyone would imagine with a cross-country move like that, but we were there for each other, and the sun was just over the horizon, within reach and we were about to grab it together. All our worries, stresses were being handled and our lives were straightening out, we were growing up together. I would have never made such a ballsy move on my own or for any other woman and I am happy to have the experience and memories! She has a large amount of family out here and all welcomed her, and to my surprise (Thought they didn’t know much about me), me with open arms. Over the span of months her family members would pull me aside with tears in their eyes, hugging me and thanking me because they had never seen her so, so happy and healthy. I’d tell them all the same thing, it was her, she overcame her addictions and took control of her mental illness. It was her who was the hero of her own story, I was just the one by her side. They’d always laugh and say of course, “but I know how much she did and how much you mean to her, I’ve never seen her love someone so much”. Her skin, her hair, her eyes, everything glowed, especially the love we had for each other, everyone could see it and it made me so proud of her, I could see our entire lives going forward, I knew we’d be on top of the world. \\n\\nThen October arrived. \\n\\nPart of “Beau’s” job requires her to travel abroad to different countries for work meetings and training. This trip was the first time she’d be making this work trip and the first time we’d be truly separated for such a large period of time. (Roughly 8 weeks with a 1 week return home in the middle). She was excited and I was excited for her as well. We knew this trip was coming and were prepared for it as best we could be mentally. We called each other daily, sometimes more, constantly texting and snapchatting, we missed each other so much. I would reassure her over the phone at night that it was going to be ok, and I knew that it must be so tough going to another country with coworkers you’ve only know for a few months, but she will be ok, and she can always call me, she’ll be right back here in no time. \\n\\nIt took one week. Exactly one week into her work trip she had an incident where she overslept so bad that her Company thought she was in serious danger. One of her coworkers had been given my number to contact to see if I had heard anything. This coworker informed me they had all gone out together and she finally caved in to have a drink, which turned into a few and now she wasn’t there for their morning meeting. This was of course very alarming, but it was quickly resolved by the hotel security; she was probably hungover and knocked out, but ok overall. I spoke with her that night and asked if everything was ok. I expected her to tell me she broke her sobriety, that she was crushed and very upset. However, she lied. She told me she was fine, just lost her phone and all was good. This surprised me, but I let it slide and didn’t inform her that I already knew, just reminded here I’m here for her always, no matter what and if she ever makes a mistake, we can work towards fixing it together. It took about a week, and she finally admitted she had broken her sobriety. She promised that she wouldn’t have another drink until her break week in November, where we would share the experience of having a few drinks as a celebration before we hop back on the wagon. She comes home in November and it’s bad. I can see it in her behavior and her physical appearance. She told me she had been drinking with her co-workers socially, had taken an edible and she was now vaping again. She admitted the vaping was bad, but the weed and alcohol were fine, she’s finally got control of herself, and we can live our lives normally as non-sobrieties. \\n\\nMedicine \\n\\nShe is diagnosed and medicated with a day-to-day pill for her Bi-Polar. She later told me that after that she had been missing doses some nights on her first week of the trip and after the night, she first consumed alcohol again, she decided to go off her Bi-polar medications completely. She said she didn’t want to take them for the rest of her life due to the side effects which I completely understood, just asking to communicate with her therapist about this and being cautious. We had already experienced a shift in the relationship on the 3rd and 4th week of the trip. I noticed she was much happier than her usual already cheerful demeanor, but wildly happy, not the “I’m passionate and excited about this trip” happy. The conversations were all over the place, but very excited. About the things she bought the things she did, the conversations she had, etc. She’d trip over herself, changing topics before finishing the one she was on. As the day’s went on outbursts of anger and fits over small things I’d say or suggest, or even about events on my side of life she wasn’t happy with or misunderstood were meant with sudden and violent outburst of anger. This is where I got worried, stupidly enough I assumed it was from our work-related stress and separation becoming taxing for us. The symptoms grew worse day by day, we stopped talking as much and she started to feel distant. I waited. I gave her room. \\n\\nBreak Week \\n\\nWhen she had returned from her first half of her work trip, things were off in many, many ways. Then again, not seeing someone for a month that you had been around every day before, I figured maybe it was just because we weren’t used to it like we were. Her mood had escalated, surprising me. The arguments were severe, the anger was sudden and hurtful, she began showing a lack of remorse for her actions and almost no accountability for her actions or outbursts. We had random moments of love and passion, but not like I had been so used too. Something wasn’t right, something was very, very wrong. I know the woman I moved out here with, but this woman that was here with me then was almost a stranger to me. Like an old friend you used to know but not really. What’s worse, she was constantly high or drinking every day we were together. She would hit her vape like a monster, 3 back-to-back deep 3 second inhales, every 5-10 minutes. She was distracted, angry, agitated, disorganized. And that’s when it hit me. The woman that returned to me was not the woman that left me in early October, the woman that I found myself face to face with was the woman I had left in January. I drove her to the airport where we had an emotional goodbye, as we all would expect. I arrived home and decided I need help. \\n\\n2nd Part of Her Work Trip \\n\\nI drove her to the airport where we had an emotional goodbye, as we all would expect. I arrived home and decided I need help. So, I Called her mother for advice and a plan. While all this was going on the days went by, then the weeks. I was hearing less and less from “Beau” and even though it hurt, I still loved her and was worried. The phone calls we did have were usually dealing with something she needed or were meant with immediate anger on her end towards me over seemingly existing. She then informed me that she was truly moving up in the world and I was just holding her back. That she can take on everything on her own, that she’s the best version of herself she’s ever been and that she was going places in life that I would never be able to hold up too and that we need to go our separate ways. At first, she would call back crying and apologizing, saying she didn’t mean it and we’ll work through it, she’s just stressed, etc. Then on the 7th week, silence. Nothing from her for days. She call’s today, informs me the relationship has failed, she doesn’t see anything in me, she needs to make decision that are in her best interest, and she could do better. Absolutely zero remorse or emotion, the girl I hugged goodbye in October, unknown to me, was the last contact I’d have with the woman I loved so much. \\n\\nNow as far as doing better than me, I mean. Ya, sure. California has actors and stuff. I’m not going to sit here and lie to you, that I’m the better choice over people like Will Smith or maybe even Dwayne Johnson THE FKIGN ROCK, but besides that? Fuck no, I’m prime real-estate and anyone who says different is either lying or...\\n\\n“Oh fuck. That’s right.\" \\n\\nThat’s when it truly registered. She is showing the signs of having a severe manic episode. The stress, stopping her meds, sudden intake of drugs and alcohol. That could be it, ya. That could be a possibility. It took me 7 weeks of pretty clear signs, but I guess I just didn’t want to believe it. Shit… maybe not better but she could definitely do smarter! \\n\\nNow as a disclaimer, I’m fully aware of the likely hood she had or still is sleeping with one of her co-workers, there’s really no reason to bring it up. I’m already well underway on trying to find my way out of the mess. However, I don’t think it’s so bad that I do what I can to help her through this until I leave, and make sure she survives this self-destruction maneuver she set herself on. She is still, at the end of the day, human. She may deal with these issues forever and continue to have difficulties keeping friends, lovers and family members. A truly sad thing it is to have BPD, I can only imagine what a life like that would be like. \\n\\nAnyways, if anyone out there has suggestions, or had similar experiences please feel free to reach out and let me know. I really do want what’s best for her and to help her in anyways I can. \\n\\nThank you all so much for reading! &lt;3', 'Flair': 'Seeking Support'}, 'Post 4': {'Title': 'Falling in love with an anime character changed my life', 'Text': 'Imagine you can only see the world in 2D. People tell you the sky is blue and you agree, you find yourself knowing where people are well enough to get around, play sports, high-five people, etc. Other people talk to you about hand-eye coordination, or maybe you do art so people talk about outlines and shading and light sources, and you completely understand what they\\'re talking about. Likewise, when you talk about your experiences, people think you\\'re talking about the exact same things as they are, and so for most of your life, you think that the very few things you just don\\'t get are just, well, normal variations in human personality and life experience. You don\\'t think you\\'re very different at all. And then imagine one day, you put on a pair of glasses and suddenly, oh woah, oh wow! Turns out your whole life you\\'ve just been missing out on a vital part of Being A Person, and you didn\\'t even know! But eventually, the magic glasses or whatever stop working and you\\'re back to your normal 2D vision life, except now that you know what it is you\\'re missing out on, you can no longer just accept your experience for what it is.\\n\\nThat\\'s sort of my situation at the moment. To give some background, I\\'m 18F, born in Eastern Europe. I lived there for the first few years of my life with my grandparents and some nannies, and then at age 6 I moved to the UK to live with my parents and went to school here for the first time. For further context, although I don\\'t want to armchair diagnose and am FAR from a professional and so won\\'t say for certain if my dad has, say, BPD or NPD, the stories from the r/ raisedby... subreddits aren\\'t too far off from his behaviour. My mum, meanwhile, is sort of extremely passive and distant. Lord forgive me for shoehorning an anime reference here, but think like, the closest a person can get to Rei Ayanami while still being considered a sane, functioning member of society. That probably sounds really mean of me but if I went into every nuance of their personalities this post would be a novel, so for the sake of brevity I\\'ll leave it here with describing them, and I guess ask away if anyone wants more detail. I will say that I don\\'t have beef with them, I don\\'t hate them or anything so please don\\'t assume that from this. Final bit of context - at school I initially had friends when I came here, but then we got moved to different classes, and then this one guy spent a couple years being a dick to me in a way that was not so much bullying as implicit playground blackmail, and then I went to secondary school where I had friends and a social life for about a year before things went south and I ended up being the smart quiet kid who everyone thinks studies 24/7.\\n\\nAnyway, I lived my life fairly normally, I thought. At 14/15, it was sort of like \\'Yeah my first few years in the UK sucked, and now I guess I worry a bit too much and overthink things, but other than that I\\'m normal in that I have hobbies, enjoy talking to friends, do what I\\'m supposed to do at school, spend time with family...\\' Now my opinion on the situation was of course debateable looking back as I was really really introverted and didn\\'t have many friends at all, my relationship with my parents was superficially friendly at best and sort of sucked otherwise whenever my dad was Having A Moment, and I didn\\'t really do any of the normal things teenagers did - but I really didn\\'t see it as that big of a deal, and I had enough of other things that made me happy.\\n\\nBut everything changed when I fell in love with an anime character.\\n\\nI know this sounds like an absolute meme so I don\\'t blame anyone for thinking I\\'m some massive troll or something. And I\\'d had my share of fictional crushes before, which mainly resulted in me reading Depressing Backstory! Emo! Overpowered!Reader X Character hurt/comfort fics, in the typical self-serving way of those stories where I looked for attention and comfort from Hot Anime Boy #52 rather than wanting to provide anything myself. This sounds like a super weird thing to think about but bear with me, this is relevant. I carried over a slightly similar pattern into certain friendships in real life: I wanted to be friends with someone, I thought we were so similar and had so much in common, I wanted to find out all about them and for them to give me attention and it made me really happy to talk to them, but mainly I fantasized from a distance. It felt like I had a much greater interest in them than normal friendship, but there wasn\\'t this romantic, relationship aspect to it. But when I eventually took off the rose tinted glasses, I realised that I was just imagining them as this Perfect Friend, idealising them instead of seeing them for who they really are.\\n\\nAnyway yeah, so at 16 I fell in love with this anime character and felt like I saw the world in 3D for the first time.\\n\\nApparently feeling emotion in your body isn\\'t some strange little placebo made up by self help tiktokers who want to steal your money? Feeling butterflies is a legit thing? Feeling physical pain when emotionally hurt is a legit thing? Knots of dread and pits of stomachs and dropping hearts aren\\'t just some stupid archaic metaphor? Human warmth actually, physically, feels warm?\\n\\nAnd also - cynical as this sounds, I used to think that when people said they loved their friends they were just saying that? Like they just wanted to sound like a good person or said it because that\\'s what everyone else did and that\\'s what you\\'re supposed to say. I thought that people helped other people out because of some moral obligation, because they didn\\'t want to be an asshole, but really they didn\\'t get anything out of it? Like people only ever did nice things because they didn\\'t want to be a bad person, like everyone was just putting on some elaborate performance of moral goodness to fit in/assuage their conscience/ not be thought of as bad, but really they didn\\'t feel too much about it either way. I thought that, when people acted impulsively or overshared or shouted at others or basically \\'lost control\\' of themselves in any way, it\\'s because they were emotionally spoilt and lacked discipline... But, uh, yeah. Now that I\\'d fallen in love with this random anime side character, I saw that people did, like, want to do nice things for others out of genuine kindness and empathy, and that people losing control of their emotions made perfect sense - because, now that my emotions felt \"3D\" and normal, I could totally see myself just losing it, or going off on someone, or letting go of my inhibitions to comfort and hug someone who was upset.\\n\\nAnyway, what it came down to in the end was that, in this specific fantasy \"relationship\" with this fictional character, I finally understood what people meant by trust and warmth and selflessness, and, more generally, human connection. Which, apparently, I\\'d been completely missing out on for as long as I can remember.\\n\\nExcept... Something doesn\\'t quite add up. If I was born without the ability to experience emotions related to human connection, then why was I able to then? Why can I still sort of access these feelings now? It seems less like a \\'I\\'m missing some vital chunk of neurology\\' thing (idk bro I\\'m not a scientist), and more like an \\'I\\'ve never trusted anyone enough to experience this before\\' type of thing, which is I guess evidenced by me not having the best parents and friends, and also by my newfound interest in age regression (the coping mechanism, NOT the kink).\\n\\nBut then, if I have the ability to feel these things and I lost it or shut it off or whatever, when did this happen? Surely not before I moved to live with my parents - I have happy memories of my early childhood and everyone says I was a happy child, I was taken care of well. But then, if I \"lost\" this ability afterwards... Well, surely I should still remember similar feelings from my childhood? Surely when I asked myself the question of \\'Do I remember feeling like this ever before?\\', some distant memory should have activated, or at least some vague feeling that yeah, this wasn\\'t completely new? I remember when I was about \\\\~7 and my dad was yelling at me for some minor inconsequential thing, and he just sort of looked at my blank face and said something along the lines of: \"You know, there\\'s people out there in the world who can\\'t love, they\\'re just incapable of it. Maybe you\\'re one of them.\" And I thought about it after because I didn\\'t want to be one of Those Bad People who clearly everyone hated so much, and the best I could come up with in my thoughts (of course I would never have said this out loud) was something like: \\'I guess... I might love my mum... Sort of? What is it meant to feel like? I guess I\\'d feel upset if something happened to her so that must be it... Yeah, I probably do love her. And if I don\\'t, I guess maybe I\\'m not old enough for that kind of feeling and I\\'ll understand when I grow up.\\' Obviously heavily paraphrased, but there were a couple instances like that and that just leaves me so fucking confused, because surely if that was true and I\\'d just never felt any kind of connection with someone then I\\'d have been a hella miserable kid, but on the other hand if I had felt it then wouldn\\'t I have known? Wouldn\\'t I have remembered something?\\n\\nTo clarify though I\\'m sure y\\'all have got the point by now, this isn\\'t really a \\'I have no one except my family/boyfriend/best friend type of thing, and not really an \\'I can\\'t open up to people\\' thing. The answers to those kinds of problems are ones I can\\'t really relate to, it\\'s not an issue of me being unable to hold a conversation or feeling too embarrassed about my niche interests or something.\\n\\nOr am I just overthinking things and really the world is a lot more cynical and 2D than I now imagine it to be? Am I not really so different from other people but it\\'s just that I can\\'t relate to them? Am I just an asshole?\\n\\nI realise this is a question better suited for professionals but currently I have 0 ability to see one. It\\'s not that I don\\'t recognise the benefits, I just can\\'t at the moment. I\\'m not looking to self diagnose either for obvious reasons, but if possible I\\'d really appreciate some suggestions of internet rabbit holes to go down to at least begin to try and answer these questions for myself, or at least a subreddit better suited to such questions than this one? I guess I\\'m just posting here because I am at my wit\\'s end trying to figure this out, and the more answers I find, the more questions I have.

MORALITY/HEALTH OBESSION AND SCARY INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS**\\n\\ni have always had a light personal obsession over my own morality and my health, but last december i began making larger changes and having more vivid ideas about myself.\\n\\ni normally never put too much thought about what i ate. suddenly, i find massive comfort in eating the same sort of foods each day and restricting myself from consuming meat, takeout, sweets, and no more than 1500 calories. i am overwhelmed by this idea that doing this will make me an inherently better person and therefore allow me to accomplish the things i want to in life, and if i dont, i am worthless.\\n\\nbefore i began following these dietary restrictions, i\\'d often find myself in urgent care because i\\'d convinced myself that something is terribly wrong with me. i was always wrong. i would waste hours and my mother\\'s money for doctors to tell me that i am fine.\\n\\ni had no problem breaking a few rules/laws as a younger teenager. suddenly, i start obsessing over ethical deontology and wondering endlessly if i am an objectively \"good\" person.\\n\\ni get thoughts like these; \"social media will make you a bad person.\" \"social media will stop you from becoming the person that you want to be.\" \"eating bad foods makes you a bad person.\" \"who could respect somebody with no self control over their eating habits\" \"if i don\\'t follow healthy rituals i will never make anything of myself\" etc.,\\n\\ni get other thoughts that convince me that i am doing harm to my friends. i have friends that are 1-2 years younger than me and sometimes, in the form of harsh thoughts, i begin to become horrified that i am taking advantage of them, influencing them, or somehow grooming them. which i have expressed one time to my friend who is a year and a half younger than me, and she thought it was absurd.\\n\\ni get thoughts that convince me that i am sick with a serious condition.\\n\\ni get night terrors. i have not gotten nightmares since i was 7-10 years old. they are vivid and normally about violence happening to members of my family. one time i dreamt that i accidentally severely injured my dog, wilson, so much so that he had a large gaping hole in his face. another time, i dreamt i was watching my brother ride his bike, and as he rode to cross the street, he got hit by a truck. i watched as his head got stuck in the front tire and his body got dragged to the curb.\\n\\n**3. I CAN NO LONGER SLEEP PROPERLY**\\n\\ni find it difficult to sleep since late last year, as well. i have began to cope with smoking weed every single night until i do fall asleep. before i began doing this, i would get obsessive thoughts and be awake for over 24 hours.\\n\\n**4.

SOCIAL ANXIETY AGAIN**\\n\\ni dreaded every single day of work because of the anxiety i would get while working with my coworkers. i have never felt this sort of undeniable anxiousness in my entire life, i have worked a few jobs before. i would stay so silent at work that one day, one of my coworkers made me laugh at something and she said \"oh thank god, i thought you hated me.\" i would have coworkers that would obviously be off-put by my quiet demeanor and speak to me as if i were a younger child.\\n\\ni remember the compliments i used to get by my peers. the topic would always be of my confidence and how easy-going i was and how easy it was for me to make friends. i found myself crying in my car after work at the realization that something has changed about me and i have no idea why. i feel as if i lost the thing that made me who i am.\\n\\n**6. FEAR OF GUILT**\\n\\ndistancing myself from my friends has brought upon this seemingly never-ending cycle of needing space from them due to feeling embarrassed every moment of my life that i\\'m not at home, to being horribly guilty that i am a terrible person that is incapable of being a good friend.\\n\\ni constantly make plans with them to compensate for the missed time and then find myself anxiously cancelling the plans when the day is near.\\n\\ni recently have been in this particular cycle with a girl i have been interested in, and though i think of her as an absolutely endlessly interesting and radiant person, i cannot stop myself from needing to cancel the plans that i make with her. i try to be honest with her but the reasons for cancelling that come out of my mouth seem so unbelievable. i dont think she understood my anxieties at all and all of it may have come sounded like lame excuses that i didn\\'t want to be around her.\\n\\nexpressing my anxieties to other people makes me sound so nuts.\\n\\ni go and see my friends only spontaneously, so i dont have time to find a reason to say no. the girl i have been seeing has noticed this and told me that it seems that i dont even want to be see her because i dont follow through on planned events.\\n\\ni couldnt find a sane explanation for my behaviors.\\n\\nat this point, i leave my house only because i feel guilty.\\n\\nthe anxieties have made it incredibly difficult to truly enjoy any type of socialization the way that i used to.\\n\\n**7. I FEEL LIKE I AM SABOTAGING MY OWN LIFE**\\n\\ni wish that i could just go and do things. i want to make friends and be a friend without having thoughts that ruin every moment for me. i want to commit to a job or a college plan that wont be burned to ash by my worries or depressions.\\n\\n**POSSIBLY NOTABLE TIMELINE:**\\n\\nwhen i was 12-13, i had many friends in many cities as i moved around quite often. i would leave my house daily to go to social events. i kept in contact with everyone consistently and rarely worried about myself too much.\\n\\nwhen i was 14-15 i would have short obsessive episodes where i began feeling very far from reality. i believed that certain things happened to me were signs of a larger outcome. i believed that certain dates and numbers meant greatly to the direction of my life. i believed i was in love with an older woman and that we were soulmates.\\n\\nwhen i was 15 these short episodes would come in the form of isolating myself from everyone in my life for weeks to a month. i would obsess over the feeling of being clean. i kept my head shaved for two years straight because the feeling of hair made me feel dirty.\\n\\nwhen i was 16, my best friend died due to a fentanyl overdose and i began obsessing over my morality. i constantly recount my words and actions and decide whether or not they were something a \"good person would do.\" i began to cut people out of my life because of my obsession with being a good person. i began to have thoughts that would contradict what i thought i truly felt.\\n\\nnow at 17, i no longer feel like i get episodes. i feel like i am in a never-ending one where i am an entirely different person. thoughts about my health and morality stop me from leaving my house and eating certain foods. it stops me from contacting my friends. it stops me from working towards my future. it stops me from sleeping.\\n\\ni miss the person that i used to be. i have not talked to anybody about this. i need advice?', 'Flair': 'Advice Needed'}}, 'emotions': {'Post 1': {'Title': \"I just can't move on after my friend with benefits (assumingly) slept with someone else without me (a very, very long post)\", 'Text': 'Hello. I\\'m sorry for making this post so lengthy, but I feel like the more context I give, the more objective people\\'s responses will be. Sorry if it\\'s too much whining and too much detail. I would very much like to speak to a therapist about this but I currently have no means to do so.\\n\\nAbout 8 months ago I fled my country and sought asylum elsewhere. It was a long and anxious trip with many obstacles in the way, but I finally made it to my destination and on the final plane there I met this guy, let\\'s call him John. He was kinda cute, very easy to talk to and turned out to be LGBT, same as I. During our eleven days at the detention center (part of the normal procedure for asylum seekers) I grew to like John and his company a lot, and, considering he was exactly my type, I offered him to start a relationship, to which he said no since he was, unlike me, a bi person and he wanted to start a family of three, with a man and a woman, even though he thought I was cute (which surprised me since back then I was quite fat). It hurt but I got over it in half a day. But there was that tiny hope things would somehow work out between us.\\n\\nAfter the detention center we were moved to an open camp and placed in the same room. At first it was just the two of us, but in about a week another guy moved in with us, which slightly upset me because it meant less private time with John. But the next month was still quite a fun time during which we were doing a lot of stuff together and discovering different ways to make our time productive as we waited for our decisions from the immigration office. For instance, I started teaching him what little of the local language I had learned.\\n\\nAt some point I realized that I wanted him and told him as much. He repeated that he found me really cute, and that he was in fact aroused by me, but he didn\\'t want sex outside of a relationship, and I didn\\'t meet a few criteria to be his partner, me being gay being the primary one. He also added that there was in fact a slight chance we might hook up, because you never know what the future holds, so it\\'s quite probable that it will happen, but not now. However, it was very hard for me to let go of it (not in the least because he\\'d make quite a few sex jokes about how I was all over him, although at the time I was happy to pick up on those and continue with my own), and I brought it up a few more times, to which he replied he\\'d talk to a therapist in the camp (who turned out to be just a social worker when I came to her), and when that has happened, he\\'d tell me if he\\'d sleep with me. There I think I started getting a little crazy at the excitement of something actually happening, in part because I\\'m 29 and I never had a chance to sleep with someone I actually liked, and all the sexual encounters I\\'d had before felt less than exciting, to put it mildly. My craziness was mainly manifested in me keeping bringing the subject up even though we had agreed on how this might happen (he had to wait three weeks before seeing the therapist). During the wait the question was brought up about us remaining friends when we leave the camp and go our separate ways, to which he said that we\\'d only remain friends if we still had common interests, and he wouldn\\'t artificially maintain our friendship should he not feel like it, which hurt me deeply. In short, \"I don\\'t know the future\".\\n\\nSo he sees the therapist at the camp and tells me that she advised him to try and move out, and that he doesn\\'t want to spoil our friendship. My world turned upside down and I was very upset by this (I think I maybe even cried), and I replied that the friendship would be very hard to maintain for me either way, because by that time I\\'d developed certain feelings for him and no matter if we had sex or not, it would cause me pain to have to let him go at some point, so why not at least have some fun before that. After which he agreed to be friends with benefits and we did something the very same day (I noticed that he was actually showing even more excitement than me as we tried to find a suitable place). In a few days I offered to do something again, he replied he doesn\\'t feel like it, and so I asked him how often he had this in mind when we made the arrangement, to which he refused to give an answer, followed by \"If you want a definite answer now, it will be never. But do you really want that answer and bereave yourself of any future opportunities? I don\\'t know the future\".\\n\\nI left my dissatisfaction with not getting an answer and my anxiety to myself. That is, instead of continuing to discuss it with him I called a friend of 15 years, who was far away in my country of origin, and described him the situation. He, being a psychiatrist, said that I sound like having BPD, considering all my past similar experiences that he was aware of, because I overreact to the slightest hint of people I care about pulling away. I scheduled for a psychiatric diagnostic but I called it off a few months later, fearing this might affect my career here (the therapist at the camp seemed glad I did).\\n\\nA few weeks into our arrangement I got upset at the latest time he was \"not in the mood\" (at this point we did it every other week), and he decided to punish me by arousing me and leaving me there to teach me how it feels. I showed my slight irritation with that by wanting to impulsively cut my contact with him as much as possible, including terminating our language lessons. I regretted it the next morning, and he revealed he felt like I was only helping him so that he would have sex with me. He also felt like I\\'d behave the same way with any other guy I\\'d be sharing the room with (both of which untrue) and he called things off, saying he doesn\\'t even need sex outside a relationship at all, a statement he repeated mutltiple times before. Besides that our friendship was completely unaffected: I would still teach him the language and we would go everywhere together, making jokes and discussing all kinds of things as before.\\n\\nAt some point we met a new guy, also a bi, a very nice one, and at some point, as the three of us were going for a walk, I left early, he said he\\'ll be back in 30 minutes, only to show up at three in the morning. I got very anxious at the idea that he has no trouble finding new romantic interests and that he\\'s now making a new one, and it wasn\\'t me. I asked him about it jokingly, to which he said I\\'ve got nothing to worry about because the other guy was not into a three-way relationship, so John quickly accepted it. As it happens, months later I became a close friend with that other guy, and he revealed a different story of how John brought it up, got immediately rejected, but pressed on with it for another 30 minutes, praising polyamorous relationships, making the other guy feel a bit uncomfortable. But back then, even not knowing that, I still felt myself like a second rate human being that anyone would gladly choose over and for a few days I would not speak to anyone, eat or leave my bed. During one of the evenings, I flipped out on John, impulsively decided to cut ties with him again, calling off our lessons, getting all my data off his laptop that he allowed me to use and even tore apart the money that I tried to give him \"for the trouble of having to deal with a crazy person\", which he refused (hence me tearing it to pieces). As I was copying my data off his laptop, I got really passive aggressive, voicing his supposed thoughts of how little he cares about me, and at some point he just dressed up and left for an hour, without answering my messages or anything after I\\'d calmed down. On the next day I tried to cut myself, but lacking courage I only managed to cut out the word \"coward\" on my forearm. On the next day I contacted a suicide hotline, and it was the first time I felt like I was being heard. The day after that I tried to talk to him about what happened and he said that he had been afraid I\\'d cut his throat in the middle of the night, and that he could no longer trust me because I already knew too much about him and he was afraid that I might leak it to some people which could get him in a lot of trouble, like his girlfriend back in his country. I felt insulted by that, since, if anything, my impulsiveness was directed at myself rather than other people, and I\\'m anything but dishonest like that, but he wouldn\\'t listen. He said we would still continue to be friends, but he would not be as open with me. After a few days of me resenting that I accepted that and went to see the therapist at the camp, only to be referred to an online video course though I actively asked to be given someone to talk to.\\n\\nWe continued our normal activities after a week\\'s hiatus. However, I noticed that engaging him in any new ones like watching a movie or taking an evening walk was very hard, although he would gladly do it with other people. However, I kept that thought to myself. After a few weeks we brought up each other\\'s insecurities again, and among many I listed my desire to have sex with him. He replied that it was possible if I didn\\'t ask about it every day or even several times a day. Having laid it off my chest, I could finally let go of that idea and concentrated on my own interests instead, and two days later he himself initiated an act, after which he said \"You are a very good person and you must stop bringing yourself down all the time\". Slowly our encounters became quite regular. Sometimes he would even show the initiative to change our living conditions at the camp so that we could have more privacy. However, he still quite often repeated that he doesn\\'t really need sex. Also around that time I started discussing the possibility of a relationship with him and what I could bring into a relationship if he would choose to be with me. After some talks he admitted that we might arrange something if his girlfriend, the one back in his country, would agree to it (they were in an open relationship). But he\\'d have to tell her he\\'s bi first, and he\\'ll only do that after getting a positive decision for the asylum. He also warned me that he doesn\\'t get attached to people and doesn\\'t develop feelings, even for his girlfriend of eight years. He also revealed that for him happiness in a relationship is when there\\'s a list of met criteria, nothing more.\\n\\nDuring those days we spent a lot of time together but mostly doing routine stuff like buying groceries and working out together (I got my BMI down from 35 to 25, feeling quite energized from being with him). Getting him to go on an evening walk to talk about stuff in a leisurely manner was impossible, though, him saying \"I don\\'t feel like doing it tonight, maybe some other day\".\\n\\nAt around that time we got to know this gay couple in an open relationship, and John got enamored with one of them, revealing to me that he\\'d like to do things with him that he wouldn\\'t with me, because we weren\\'t in a relationship. I expressed my preference to engage into it together if he wanted. To which John replied that it likely wouldn\\'t happen at all because he was afraid of STDs from him, unlike me, whose fidelity did not come into question. He also asked me why he should treat me as someone special, to which I replied that we enjoy each other\\'s company very much (which he had previously admitted several times) and that I already have feelings for him, but he responded with \"I don\\'t develop any attachments or feelings, for anyone\".\\n\\nOne day I went on a trip to a big city and I really loved it there. I was overcome with positive emotions and wanted to share it with John. However, upon returning back to the camp, he showed very little interest in discussing it. He denied having a bad mood and instead claimed to have a \"usual\" mood, which was in stark contrast to his usual cheerful self. I got really hurt, I tried discussing it with him, but he only gave me simple answers to all my questions like \"yes\", \"no\", \"maybe\", \"if that\\'s what you think\". Feeling I need to be heard I secretly talked to a common friend of ours about it and told him everything. He really helped me calm down. During our talk, he asked a question I didn\\'t \"need to answer\" about specific details of our intercourses. Taken by surprise, I answered, which I now realize I shouldn\\'t have. In the end, I swallowed my hurt feelings and closed my eyes on it. John stayed in his \"usual\" mood for another week before getting back to his talkative self.\\n\\nHis 30th birthday was a few months away, so I asked him what he wanted for a present. He followed with saying he doesn\\'t celebrate birthdays and he doesn\\'t like gifts because people never get him what he needs, and even if my gift turns out to be a good one, he will pretend it\\'s awful, just to discourage me from future presents. His reasoning was his way of doing things should be respected. Obviously, when I asked if he\\'d give me a present on my birthday, which I\\'ll gladly receive even if it\\'s a small one, it was also a no.\\n\\nOne day I got a notice that I have to leave for another (much worse) camp immediately. There were multiple reasons why I didn\\'t want to do this, but the major one was me separating from him. Another one being that on the previous day the charger port on his laptop broke as I was using it. I tried to pay him, but he refused saying \"It was a very old laptop, the charger ports are the weak part of the model, it was bound to happen\" (by that time he had bought himself a second hand gaming PC). I also expressed my concern to him that the moment I leave he\\'d go doing stuff with that gay couple immediately, to which he said he had \"already told me why that was unlikely\". On the next day, the day of my departure, I confronted him about the lack of apparent disappointment at my departure, to which he said \"that\\'s life, people come and go\", and, hurt me by the implication that we\\'re saying goodbyes for good, I asked him whether he\\'s gonna contact me, whether he minds me coming to see him, having heard in return \"You can visit me all you want, I cannot tell people what to do, but I\\'m not gonna show any initiative in keeping in touch with you\". He refused to go for a last walk before I leave as we\\'d previously planned, frustratingly saying \"stop acting as if this is the last time we meet\". Eventually I flipped out at how contradicting he sounded and left for the train station on my own. We didn\\'t talk for a few days, until he called me about what to do with some of the stuff I left behind. He was pretty cheerful and talkative again, so I decided to let go of the pain I had and resume talking to him.\\n\\nFeeling all alone in the new camp with worse conditions, I\\'d call him every day and we\\'d talk for hours, discussing all kind of stuff. During one such call he said that he\\'s very glad we\\'re still talking to one another. But he also warned me that our arrangement might soon end because he doesn\\'t really need sex, not outside of a relationship anyway. I suggested I come visit him during the next weekend. However, I noticed that often when I called him he\\'d be at the gay couple\\'s house, often for hours well past midnight. I discussed the possibility of us four doing something together when I come visit, because I knew John wanted to engage with them, and I wanted to share that experience with him. During one such calls he said \"I need to talk to you about something, but I can\\'t talk here, I\\'ll tell you later when I\\'m back in the camp\", which was on the next day because he stayed at their place for the night. He told me he wanted to do something special with me alone when I come to see him, which elevated me quite a lot.\\n\\nI met him during the weekend and he revealed that he did in fact discuss with the couple the possibility of engaging with them and that that couple were in an open relationship but not really, so it was unlikely something was to happen between the four of us that night. We then had our special private time that he\\'d talked about and then headed to the couple\\'s place. We stayed up till very late and indeed nothing happened. The subject of attatchments was brought up, and while everyone else defended their value, he was resilient in \"attatchments only ever cause pain\". We shared a bed in a separate room that night, and on the next day we had a long walk where we talked about a lot of things, including the possible relationship between us, that he fears I won\\'t be happy with him, why I want to be with him and that I\\'d be able to accept him as he was as long as he\\'s there. We then concluded our conversation with words of mutual admiration and respect.\\n\\nOn my way back to the camp I felt overwhelmed with positive emotions and shared them with that common friend of ours in whom I confided during my troubles with John. Immediately after we hang up I felt really bad that I disclosed some of the details about our special intercourse that weekend, and I couldn\\'t sleep all night. Against my psychiatrist friend\\'s advice not to confess I confessed to John about it because I couldn\\'t bear the guilt and felt like I would not be able to talk to him as before with that guilt inside. He said that it doesn\\'t change anything, although he didn\\'t find it pleasent and needed to think about it. I cried many times that day fearing I broke the special kind of trust we had established, but on the next day he said he still didn\\'t give it any thought and couldn\\'t provide any comment.\\n\\nLater that day we were supposed to have a language lesson online. I was very distraught with the situation from the day before and decided to confess my love to him during the lesson in plain words (prior to that we always referred to it as just \"feelings\", he doesn\\'t believe in love), even though I knew he suspected it. However, when I called him, he was taking a walk with the couple and he said he was gonna be late. A few hours later he was at their place and there was not gonna be a lesson at all. He left them well after midnight, and then called me as I asked. I confessed my love to him, but then I asked him whether they did something or discussed sex with the couple, saying I don\\'t mind if he did, I just want to know. After five seconds of silence, he refused to comment on that, saying he\\'s \"not obliged to report to anyone\". The more we talked (during which he didn\\'t engage into conversation much or give any comment besides \"if you see it that way\"), the more resentful I got, eventually telling him I don\\'t ever want to talk to him again. As my thoughts raced through my head I called him several times that night, quite sour, I\\'m afraid, but he chose not to provide any thoughts on the situation.\\n\\nDuring the next two days I called him a few more times, trying to get him to talk, but the only comment I got out of him is there was no longer any possibility of us ever being in a relationship or having sex because I was too jealous. Angry and hurt, I told him I\\'d pay for the laptop repair, he initially refused, then he gave me the amount for the laptop \"if that will make you feel easier\". I paid double the amount. He didn\\'t mind us being just friends, but he refused to acknowledge that I would initially have a hard time being a friend, distraught as I was, and he said if I can\\'t be friends, then so be it, everyone is replaceable. I agreed to keep our friendship, but had little faith in it. I wouldn\\'t contact him, and he contacted me only once with a brief notice when I\\'m to expect my data off his laptop.\\n\\nAfter several days of us not keeping in touch, I got sour, doubled by the fact that there\\'re no opportunities in my new camp for me to learn programming since there wasn\\'t even a computer class (unlike in the previous camp). I called him and not in the nicest manner asked him how much he wants for his laptop that he obviously doesn\\'t need (he indeed was selling it at the time). He then said he could give it to me free, unrepaired and without an SSD (as it contained his data). He refused to repair it using the money I had previously sent him and even if I bought his laptop at a higher price. Shocked at this response, I called him on his weird friendship if he can\\'t take a five minute walk to the tech service to help me out even though I\\'m ready to pay for the expenses. I said that I find him unpleasant and refused to give him any more detail, mirroring his own style of leading an uneasy conversation. He blew up with \"you turned out to be an interesting person\", wished me well, asked me to never call him again and hang up. I felt rage mixed with fear and started calling him every 10 seconds or so, he would not pick up. Ten minutes later he blocked me everywhere he could. I tried to make contact with him days later through our common friends, he told them he does not wish to speak to me and feels sorry they\\'re being dragged into this.\\n\\nFast forward one month, I still regularly cry about how the whole situation turned out. His birthday was last week, I didn\\'t even attempt to contact him, feeling like that would be imposing my own worldview on his. Two days later there was an event that we both signed up for months ago, and I hoped to have a word with him there. I met our common friends there, and they said \"he didn\\'t receive his free ticket and he refused to contact the admins of the event about that\". I asked them to tell him to I wanted him to contact me. On the next day he replied to them that he doesn\\'t \"want to deal with [me]\", stating that our worldviews are different. What I did learn through them, however, is that he did in fact celebrate his birthday. At the couple\\'s place.\\n\\nI am now feeling totally destroyed. He didn\\'t need sex outside of a relationship and said that he could do without it, and at the same time he actively approached others about it. He didn\\'t want to do specific things during the intercourse outside of a relationship, yet he was open about doing them with the couple. He said I don\\'t have to worry about him engaging with them, and yet immediately after I left he spent most of his time with them, either staying at their place well after midnight or even for a sleepover several times a week. He said he doesn\\'t believe in love and only a list of criteria, one of which the other guy also being a bi, and yet he showed interest to other gay people, just not me. He said he didn\\'t want to celebrate his birthday and would intentionally discourage me from giving him a present yet he did the very same thing with that couple. When I run into our common friends he gives them a call yet he stated on multiple occasions he would not show initiative with me because \"he never does with anyone\". He said he never treats anyone in a special way, and yet I feel that he does with anyone but me. My own 30th birthday is in two weeks and I don\\'t have a place, the money or a special someone to celebrate it with, yet John who allegedly never wanted to gets all three.\\n\\nI feel like I\\'m a second rate person that anyone would gladly choose over the first chance he gets. Whenever I close my eyes all I can think of is him doing stuff with that couple and showing them the investment I craved for. I rarely want to actually have sex with anyone at all, for me it\\'s always coupled with the yearning for a deep connection, and so far it happened when I was 11, then 15, then 21 (all three without anything between us, just the yearning), and now 29. At this rate the next time I feel interested in anyone is when I\\'m 41 and I already dread what is to happen then. Beyond that I don\\'t find sex pleasurable at all, the only time it was was with John. I don\\'t have any interest in meeting other guys just for the sake of meeting. Not that I never did so, but it ended up in a relationship that lasted 1.5 months and I was glad when he called things off.\\n\\nWhat we had with John was the closest thing I had to a happy relationship. He provided care and support, and around him I felt like wanting to be better: I lost weight, I quit drinking alcohol (I drank almost daily since my last traumatizing love interest, which makes it almost seven years) and I tried to respect his boundaries the best I could, but maybe not well enough. Now I can\\'t sleep at night, my lungs feel like they\\'re filled with lead and I can\\'t breath. I wish I had a time machine to change my behavior and preserve this thing, so that I could tell myself \"Careful, this is your first experience close to a real relationship, you need to learn a lot and think before you act if you don\\'t want to mess it up\". But then I start thinking back about that time and ask myself \"Was it really me who messed it up or was he simply not into me from the get go?\" I can\\'t enjoy anything these days, good news like me getting an asylum, being enlisted for a social housing don\\'t bring me joy, and any activity that requires concentration like language learning just results in my thoughts straying away to what really bothers me, because I still love him and can\\'t accept the reality. The only thing that helps me sleep at night is thinking of all the things I could do to myself to end my misery. I won\\'t do it, given what a coward I am. But those thoughts are a weird comfort.', 'Flair': 'Sadness / Grief'}, 'Post 2': {'Title': \"A scream about several lives ruined by me that I clearly can't handle alone (though I deserve to deal with that alone)\", 'Text': \"My issue is complicated cause there are 3 people involved excluding myself as a trigger for them. And my parents are also in the picture.\\n\\nI just don’t know what to do and how to handle this situation I have.\\n\\nI am sorry for any grammar errors and misprints and all that, I am not a native English speaker at all. \\n\\nI’ll try to sum it up as short as possible (spoiler alert: it WON’T be short at any means, I am sorry). So… \\n\\nMy background is not good but not as a bad as it can get in this world. \\n\\nMy mom was depressed since I was born so she has kinda never recovered and she was never available to me emotionally, she had been providing for me and my disabled younger brother and we were financially covered but that is it. She also could beat me to black and blue but it rarely happened honestly cause she was too tired for this kind of ‘exercise’. So it was mostly neglecting mixed with rare physical or psychological/emotional abuse. At 17 I literally thought that I do not have a mom (though I thought that without fully realizing it till last year and I am 30).\\n\\nMy father was not emotional at all (like men can’t be emotional type of shit), he grew up with a father that had beaten all of his children so my father used the same tactic with me and my brother. But all my sweet and heart-warming memories (not so much of them but they are pretty solid and even character-building) were with him. Because he could beat me to the point I couldn’t seat or stand without pain and still be my role model who could comfort me, find the right words and stand for me in some cases, it has obviously messed up with my relationship image in general.  \\n\\nMy father passed away several years ago and left me a fortune that I didn’t know he had. I now realize that he actually did love me but he also wasn’t taught by his parents how to express love and all that stuff. But he did apologize to me when I was around 20 years old that he wasn't a good father to me when I was little and that he should've paid me more attention.\\n\\nMy mom… she had still provided me financially until father’s death but I cannot forgive her for neglecting. I don’t feel any grudge towards her, I feel nothing. The thing is that now she needs my love, attention, emotional support — all these things I needed from her when I was a little girl and never received — and I cannot give it to her though I try being gentle and understanding with her. She is old and she also had things to be depressed about but... I have no good memories with her. Well, maybe one or two that were so random and honestly messed with me more than if she didn’t do it. She did good things to me (like paying for my therapy afterwards for several years) but I know it is more to her as to consider herself ‘a good mother after all’ than anything else. It is also a deeply messed up scenario from her childhood she learned and repeated in her adult life. \\n\\nI am bipolar. I have struggled with suicide thoughts and kinda attempts since I was a kid (like 7 years old is the youngest age I have proof of), I had also done self-harm. I was diagnosed at 22 years old and since then I was in therapy and tried different meds to find the right ones. Sometimes I had quit meds for long periods of time and I left therapy for almost two years and came back to the same therapist several months ago. But bipolar disorder has been affecting my life since I was little for sure.\\n\\nSo… the actual story.\\n\\nAs a 12 years old girl who thought of herself as worthless I once saved myself from suicide with a sudden thought that ‘if there is no one to love me right now, maybe one day I’ll meet someone who will’. This idea gave me enough hope to move on with my life in a permanent waiting mode. I thought my life will begin when I find people who are interested in me and now I just have to wait. \\n\\nAnd I met people. Online and in school. And some deep connections were build. \\n\\nI’ll cut it to three people. \\n\\nThe first one will be L. She was my classmate but we started hanging out together only in middle school. I knew right away that 'she was my best friend for life but she just didn’t know it yet' kind of thing. And a year later that we became close friends she said that she was moving to another city. I remember how my world just broke into pieces when she told it on the phone. I remember secretly crying behind her back when she was playing on piano for me for the last time.\\n\\nWe kept our friendship though through all these years. But we both had been very dysfunctional at building meaningful connections so our dysfuncionalities kinda worked for our friendship to last. The dark side is that I have hurt her too many times and she is the most forgiving person I know so I could get away with it for a long time. Now, thankfully for her, she is calling out me for all shit so we can discuss it and let it go. Honestly, I think that she has never hurt me. Even accidentally. \\n\\nI do have a cousin who had been living in a different country and I had close relationship with her through letters (yeah, paper one that took forever to arrive) but I could meet her once in a year or several years. So L was my actual first friend in school.\\n\\nThe second relationship is the most complicated I had. Her name will be O. \\n\\nShortly, O was kinda similar to my father behavior in a weird way but still she would give me lots of closure for pain my mom caused me. At first, she was ‘brutally honest’ that I had been taking closely to my heart thinking that she was not liking me at all and just critiquing me for fun and for the sake of being mean. She liked being mean and I liked her when she was being mean, even to me, but this is nowhere healthy. After several years spent together with some things happened, I had developed a thought that she had kinda become responsible forever for what she had tamed meaning me desperately clinging to her. She was responsible for me in my mind, you know? Like my father was responsible for me also. I don’t consider mom’s providing as being responsible towards me cause she had never participated in my upbringing. And… I thought that if O was being just responsible, she didn’t care about me that much. I was kind of her duty in my damaged thinking. I didn’t know that my father loved me and cared about me too much even (if it is possible for a parent) so it was a real thought that she had been taking care of me just because she felt like she had to. I could say to her things like ‘you don’t care about me!’ and then blackmail her to kill myself if she didn't do things for me, even though she did comfort me and did save me from my suicide thoughts (the real ones in moments and in general from the whole idea that I deserve to be dead). I said bad things to her, I was neglecting her own feelings for years, making her feel worse about herself.\\n\\nAnd the worst part is that I was and am actually in love with her. Always been. That is the reason I myself let her be so influential towards me. She was the only one who could really talk me out of shit because she was the only one I would listen to. L’s tears made me feel bad about hurting her but it had never changed my intentions to kill myself or to stop self-harming. But O could. Though she truly believed that all my bad stuff was happening because of her, like in past she said some mean things to me. It was me who made her believe that.\\n\\nAnd she doesn’t know about my feelings because I had been suppressing them for way to long trying not to come out even to myself officially like saying it out loud in my head. I thought that if I reveal it in any way, all would be ruined. I had never thought that suppressing such strong feelings could not do good for me and this relationship. And yes, I don't think she is bi as myself. Who would want a friend coming out of friend zone and being your gender even? I had experience with a male friend having strong feelings for me, it was not good for both of us and did not end well. \\n\\nSo one day four years ago I had a horrible fight with O. And by horrible I mean I was horrible. Like what the hell was that? I don’t really have a solid answer and it doesn’t matter cause my whole behavior towards her for last several years before the fight was abusive and toxic. And I literally thought that it was me who was the victim. \\n\\nShe left me. \\n\\nBut all those four years she kept coming to say to me happy birthday once a year. \\n\\nThis year I got to talk to her and her answer… Well. In my words, I think she has feelings towards me similar like I have for my mom. Like nothing can be done to rebuild it. I would do anything for her so she could be my friend again but the same goes for my mom because my mom says she’ll do anything I order her just to get my trust back and to earn warm feelings for her and… I believe her but there is nothing. Unfortunately. So I get from O's answer kinda same feeling. Just one message though it was a bit long and it was undoubtedly hard for her to write me back. That is it. I think she is not coming back and it was clear for her four years ago but not for me. I kept hoping that I would understand one day how I hurt her in that fight and that I would get another chance. I am too good at deceiving myself with illusions.\\n\\nThe third valuable friendship I have is with M. We also met online and I thought of her as my younger sister or even friend-soulmate. Now I think that we had some kind of honeymoon for friends with no fighting that lasted way too long so I got assured that we couldn't fight or hold grudges against each other whatsoever. The truth is that there were truly more me than us in our friendship and eventually I broke her trust by being the same egoist as with L and O. We had one mutual project that kept us together. She now is really trying to become my friend again, she is putting lots of effort to keep that project going, she is trying to move on with my past shit and she is trying to listen to what I can explain to her about this shit. Her words are that I didn’t do any kind of big betrayal or whatnot to her so why can’t we be close friends again? It just takes time, and she doesn't know how much will be needed. But she clearly has learned not to trust me so I don’t even know what is going on with her. Timing is almost the same — almost four years. We have safe topics to talk about. And what is this big betrayal anyway? Why should it be big? How big? I think that because I cut her of my support and deeply hurt her in her time of need, it was a betrayal. She might be confused with that and she did tell that she didn’t leave solely because of the project. And to be honest, it is mostly my own project so I feel like I am taking her hostage with this. You know, when one parent is trying to hold on to another parent through mutual child. \\n\\nAnd I did all these things because of my unhealthy relationship with parents and bipolar disorder with way too strong mood swings without realizing that I was hurting my closest people. Even maybe hurting them the way I was hurt by my parents. \\n\\nAnd last year I had all those insights about my behavior and motivation behind it, I now can see where I really messed up without bursting into some sort of hysterics with blackmailing to kill myself with a bullshit reason like ‘if i am such a bad person to you, I should kill myself’. I really think I can build healthy relationship now. That I can be a good friend to my friends because I was not a good friend to any of them for a decade. I wasn’t there for them when I promised. And as in Lilo &amp; Stitch ‘I always said how I needed you but you needed me more’. \\n\\nI feel like I am dangerous for L and M. In the past I did burst into tears and tell O that she should get rid of me cause I am so bad. She would comfort me then and reassure me that I am not bad, that I am actually so great. And now I clearly see all the evidence that I was bad not just to O and then M, I really hoped that maybe relationship with L was different somehow but it was not. I see where and why. Of course, I wasn't bad in their eyes at that time. But the badness kept becoming in a giant mountain that crushed them eventually.\\n\\nI really relate to Stitch who just wanted his own 'ohana'-family but was built to destroy anything he touches. I am sorry, I had never watched this movie until recently so I make references. Though I see references to my situation in almost any movie or anime or whatever. Especially with O.\\n\\nAnd with seeing all my shit I am lost because I just can’t see any good I did for them. Things that they all loved about me and things they loved me for. I am starting to believe that I had definitely used some magic on them. Abusers can do that. But saying that is disgraceful for their feelings. They didn’t love some imposter, they loved me and they kept spending lots of time with me. Once I had a skype call with O for 19 hours straight. With M I would go to sleep with her messages and when I woke up her messages would be the first ones to see. \\n\\nAnd what should I do with this 'good' things I have done for them? Like 'Oh I hurt you so bad you can't even talk to me but I did this good thing to you too!'? \\n\\nI could've used these potential good things as example actions that I should nurture and do for them more often. But are there any? I feel like if there are any, it is not enough.\\n\\nI also had for 13 years another friend but recently she broke up with me saying that I was always trying to make her change her mind and that we had too much tension I wasn’t even aware of. \\n\\nI feel like I should not try to beg O to answer me more (though I did do that with too many messages) and also I should let others go. First, speaking honestly with M and L that… maybe sometimes relationships that had lasted a decade and more cannot be saved or shouldn’t be saved. All good things come to an end, you know. Letting go.\\n\\nBut I can't let go. I even refuse to.\\n\\nI also feel like I can change for them. I am also willing to go too far with that. Like giving my father’s fortune to O cause she has always been short on money (she won't accept it though and will be quite offended if I do so, so I am trapped again). But inner change cannot be done overnight and I keep hurting L and M right now. Doing or saying before thinking kind of thing and realizing it later or even in the moment but it is too late. Harm is done. And is it even worth it for them to stay, to be hurt by me from time to time so I could learn new behavior? Am I worth it? How would I know? I know I can become a good friend, I have all the knowledge about me and my bugs but I have all the evidence that I couldn't while there were chances and I do not have any guarantee that I can change. I clearly had never had a healthy relationship so why am I so certain I can learn it in the process when the damage is undeniably huge? Where is the line where you have to give up? Even if I cannot give up on them being my friends.\\n\\nI know they all had saved my life with their support in my time of need. Especially O, I give her lots of credits for that. Maybe it is time to save theirs with cutting me out of their lives? Not literally, I am not talking about killing myself.\\n\\nI am not suicidal anymore. I do want to self-harm because of all this unbearable guilt and the urge is really strong but I am in therapy and I resist the urge successfully. I will be totally fine without them once I will go through all stages of grief caused by guilt and broke-ups. But will they be fine if staying with me? Maybe yeah, I will change but won’t it be for them like… like they are exhausted of all the way made and are not happy about the fact that they actually made it with relationship with me?\\n\\nLike I am that dumb little sister in Atonement movie who did dumb shit without being able to realize the truth due to her age and because of that ruined so many lives that were precious to her. By the way, I totally hated and judged her when I watched the movie. Mr Freud, was that you? (a miserable joke for those who do know psychoanalysis therapy too well)\\n\\nI know I can be a better person now. I fought all my demons and now, I guess, the guilt demon is the next boss. But what is the winning method to defeat it? To break up with these two wonderful people (because O is not coming back though it is vitally important for me but not in the way that I would commit suicide or harm myself because I promised her I won't do that) for the sake of those people’s lives or to keep fighting previous demons’ consequences alongside with my friends? \\n\\nI feel like I don’t need any close relationship anymore. I do not need any more drama and this mutual pain and I am so content with my life plans that I truly believe I won’t need one that is so close as all those were to me. I just need, like vitally need, all those three relationships in my life. I need a chance that is not even the second for them and that I don’t even deserve. \\n\\nFun fact though. I have never seen O and M. I have heard O’s voice but that is it. L is my classmate so obviously we know each other in real life. The friend that broke up with me was also an online friend but we did exchange photos and videos or turn camera on during calls, and she was friends with O too but broke up with her as well two years before breaking up with me (never seen O either but talked to her as well via skype and such). And we all live in different cities and even countries. And yeah, we are talking 10+ years of friendship with all this suicide saving shit.\\n\\nOmg. That is a lot. And I am not even sure that I told all the important stuff to judge me. \\n\\nI don’t know what I want by talking to strangers about it. I am so deeply hurt but I am not the victim and never was. I hurt myself that I was ignorant towards my loved ones and made them suffer with my unacceptable behavior yet driven by a mental disease. This shit happens in books and movies or even TV series but for one life it is just too much to handle. I don’t really know how to get through this realizing process with deep insights and grief that I lost those who I truly needed in the end. \\n\\nMaybe M and L also will also leave me one day. Without going till the end. Maybe they should. \\n\\nAnd I am such a lucky bitch, honestly. Everything works out for me every single time. I am in a very good place in my life right now. Yeah. Because my beloved friends made so much effort to help me and to save me. And my father. And even my mother did her good piece. Luck will end somewhere, it cannot last anytime I need it. And I feel like my luck regarding inner changing and bringing O back ended way back in the past without me noticing. Like my luck brought me to those people who could save me from me but now… it is just over. You can’t talk about luck if you hurt people and want them egoistically back because all of the sudden you are in love with them. Just because I have this thought it shows that I am still not a good person. Though yeah, bad thoughts don’t make us bad people but… I had too many bad actions towards my friends. I have to deal with consequences of losing them all.\\n\\nAnd I want to punish myself for that! And I can’t because of self-love shit and they wouldn’t want me to go to that dark hole of self-hate again. How can I hate myself in a fucking healthy way?? Is there any?? I don’t know anymore. I clearly lost. I do not handle this well. I wanna scream that loud that even aliens would hear but this won't help so I keep my silence. Maybe this reddit post is my way to scream internally while keeping silence. I did this to myself but with certain 'help' of my mental illness and messed up upbringing so I can and cannot fully blame myself at the same time, and this forced attempt to accept my traumatized inner-child or whatever is driving me crazy but I can't go to self-hate and self-harm... Not after they did for me. \\n\\nI hope that because this post is way too long it should be clear that I do not overthink or exaggerate that much. I do admit though that I might be romanticizing O (her saving my life entirely) a little bit (just a little bit of reality here because a person in love is always wearing rose-colored glasses) and that I am clearly lost in this spiral but the situation seems to me so doomed that it is already just pure despair with great clarity level within me. Despair zen, let's make another stupid joke.\\n\\nYou are welcome to ask questions if you want to but I won't be sharing too much info also. Cause all of my three dearest friends do know English and there is always a chance they will find out about me posting this. Not sure if I can handle that but I can't handle this internal non-terminating scream either. In the end I am being my egoistic self till the very core.\", 'Flair': 'Sadness / Grief'}, 'Post 3': {'Title': \"life's unfare\", 'Text': 'I was born to a teen mom with a man way older then her. He ended up leave us after my little sister was born and my mom ened up miving us to Washington state where i would start going to therapy for the first and only time, I was only 4 and already had problems. I was there to talk about my father and the abuse he inflicted on my which included water deprivation, neglected, and physical abuse. We stayed in washington until was about 6 and my mom was put in jail for vandalism and me and my sister were taken by cps and place in the care of my biological granpa and is new wife after he remarried. They were sweet and everything but i found myself cry cuz i missed my mom. After about 6 months my mom came for us. When she got out of jail she had started a new life in ohio and gotten a new boyfriend, we will call him Austin. Austin was the son a a guy who used \"the selling of exercise\" as a cover up in using women to earn money with home test and visits, who my mom was working for at the time. And his son Austin was obsessed with my mom so on the condition that he and my mom date my mom would be given good income and opportunities to earn money she well she established herself in new state. So while my mom was working she left us in the care of Austin who would completely ignore us, and when my mom would get done from working him and her usually ended up in arguments where he end up getting frustrated and hurt her. My sister would usually come to me during all this and I would try to comfort her the best I could but as a 7-year-old there\\'s not really much you can do or say to justify the situation that a 4-year-old is witnessing. I should probably not at this point that we never really had a house we lived in hotels during most of this which made it hard for us to go to school and even when we could we would have many days but we were absent. My mom soon realized that we can\\'t be near him so she sent us to live with a nanny in a small town in Ohio where we could be in school. The lady that was taking care of us was also taking care of a little boy who will call Jay he was probably only about one and a half years old when we first got there. We were told that his mom was a meth addict and was mentally unable to take care of her child so the nanny ended up adopting him with her consent. I left my time there it was peaceful and she and her husband were always kind, and I even cared for little baby Jay and started wanting a little brother. Probably a year later when we were still living with her my wish was granted but not in the way that is ethically okay. My mom came to visit me and my sister and tell us that our father had been arrested for raping a 16 year old girl a few months ago and she ended up getting pregnant and decided to keep the baby. She was a couple months away from giving birth to a boy. I was happy to know I have a brother on the way but that I would never be able to meet him because the mother wanted nothing to do with our family or my fathers, which I think of as completely rational and I don\\'t blame her. Soon after that my mim and Austin started to attend a clinic that was about 1 hour and one a week my mom would go snd get a small cup with a pink liquid in and i didnt knkw why she went there at the time. It was a clinic to help people were addict to drugs get off of them. Im happy now to know that my mom was trying to better herself even if it didnt end up lasting. The summer right before I started 4th grade my mom and Austin decided to break up because she had apparently fallen in love with someone. She had met him at the clinic that she had been going to for a while. She finally decided it was time for me and my sister to meet him and I knew from First Impressions alone that he was not okay. We\\'re going to call this new guy Kenneth. There was just something about him that screamed danger to me and I tried to tell my mom that I didn\\'t like him. She didn\\'t listen to me though and so I took it upon myself to tell him to his face that I didn\\'t like him and he needs to go. But he didn\\'t and my mom so in love with him that even she started to neglect me and my sister. My sister was still young enough to where she could grow an attachment to Kenneth and ended up starting to think of him as her father but to me he was a man who my mother shouldn\\'t be with and I violently pushed back against him constantly. He and I would get into verbal arguments and he never believed me when I said I was sick and would force me to go to school he neglected all of my wishes and forced me to do things I didn\\'t want to. There was even a time when I was home sick with a extremely high fever and he forced me to exercise for that 6 hours while my mom was at work and my sister was at school saying that I was faking it until I eventually passed out and when my mom got home had to take me to the hospital. He never faced any repercussions for these actions even if I told people no one believed me because my sister was treated well by him. It was probably 3 years into my mother and his relationship that i started to act out in destructive ways at school and the counselor ended up calling my mom to the school in telling her that I needed ways to cope with my anger in constructive ways. One of these ways she suggested was to give me an Apple whenever I was upset or angry and have me unleash all of my Fury upon it and then eat it. Which doesn\\'t make much sense now that I think about it and to be honest it didn\\'t really help. My issues still went unattended to so I ended up bottling them up and acted like I was okay again. I chose to do this because my mom had made it very clear that my emotions were invalid and that I had no reason to hate him, and it was painfully obvious at this point she wasn\\'t going to stop dating him just because I asked her to. So I acted like I had no issues with Kenneth either. I would complain to my friends that I disliked him but I would never vent my frustration with anyone else. The summer that I was exiting 8th grade going into my freshman year grandparents on my father\\'s side decided they were going to reach out to me and my sister and make it a yearly tradition that we visit them and my mom saw this is an opportunity for us to get to know our family better. So we left we were to stay with them during the week of Juneteenth and the week after. I haven\\'t mentioned this before but I\\'m mixed, my father was a light skin African-American and my mother is Caucasian. I was white passing and my sister was very obviously African-American even though my hair is Curly and her hair is straight and she\\'s only probably two or three Shades Darker than I am. So we were left with complete strangers for basically two weeks this first visit there was fine we met our cousins and you could say our time there was fun. Next summer when I was exiting freshman year going into sophomore year of high school and this is where stuff really began to go downhill for my life. Even if I didn\\'t like who my mom was with at the time I had stability and a friend group who I had built over that 7-year period even if we started drifting apart and started self-harming as the beginning of my childhood started catching up with me and i never really went anywhere and even attempted to Suicide a couple times at this point, it was still stability which if I could have the chance to go back to that life versus the one I\\'m at now I would take it any day. We were the first weekend too this trip when we got a call from Kenneth saying he was on his way down to get us because he and my mom were breaking up. So of course I call my mom and let her know what he had said and she reacted violently and told us we needed to come home immediately. So my grandparents put us on a plane and flew us back. When me and my sister finally got back my mom was waiting for us at the airport and she took us to a hotel and not her house and when we entered the room we had seen she had packed up only clothes and she had gotten her dog. Our dog at the time was black but upon seeing her I realized that she had been doused in Bleach. Her black fur was now bleach blonde and she had terrible Burns and I realize what happened. Kenneth had pour bleach on my mom\\'s dog well they were arguing. We stayed in town for three days as my mom kept going from the hotel to the house to grab more of our belongings before we begin my second trip across the US to Washington once again. If you didn\\'t know the trip is 3 days. If there is only one driver. My mother decided to pawn a bunch of her stuff to have money for the journey and decided that it would be best if we took this time to enjoy ourselves with our Newfound freedom. Looking back at it now it was just my mom\\'s way of trying to cope so upon our way across the us we stopped in Chicago Minneapolis and Montana where we would take tons of pictures and post them on her facebook. While passing through Idaho we went to a family members wedding before we decided to head to Washington. We were staying with one of my moms friends from when we lived there before. When we started to settle is when I started noticing problems with my mom. She was more jumpy and had started hoarding paperwork and was obsessed with documenting everything going on. I asked her what was going on and she replied with she thinks that Austin and Kenneth we\\'re trying to kill her. I was still a child at this time and so obviously I believed what she was saying and I let her confide in me when she needed it and I was there for her. She ended up telling my sister about it too and my sister started coming to me with her problems as well and I became this pillar for my family. Somehow through my mom falling into insanity I managed to Never Cry till on my birthday when I turned 16 and I was on the phone with my long time long distance friend of about 6 years at this point when I finally decided to tell him what was going on. My mom went so crazy that she believed that the friend of hers that we were staying with was trying to kill her as well like she had been hired by Austin and Kenneth to murder Us in her house so we had to leave according to my mom. We ran away once again to Idaho where we stayed with her parents for a while until they kicked us out on my sister\\'s birthday because my mom was insane. And so my mom reached out to you one of her old friends from middle school who she had used to date and asked him if we could stay with him and he agreed and let us stay. I started my sophomore year and I started being stalked by one of my upper classmen, it was a weird experience to say the least. My mom went to the police to report him and while we were there she decided to tell them about Austin and Kenneth and they ended up turning us away due to my mother\\'s insanity. She became obsessed with learning about Electronics and trying to understand how they work because she believed that people were hacking into our phones and computers to try and get her killed or take it to jail. I didn\\'t know why my mom was acting like this at the time but I do know. We only lived in Idaho for about 6 months and then due to price is being too high there in the city we left and headed down south to live with her biological mother. When we move down here where I\\'m currently living there was no problems except for my mom\\'s ramblings and obsession with electronic devices and security and stuff like that. Grandma had a new husband who was very Meek and didn\\'t really say much he was okay. We lived rather peacefully for a while and then covid-19 happened and the lockdown. About summer when they decided to cancel school for the rest of the year and my grandma decided it would be a good idea for us to starting Garden to keep ourselves distracted during these trying times. So we helped her clear out her backyard weed and making girl box where we could start growing our own fruits and vegetables. It was supposed to be the Family Garden but it was really just her garden that she made let\\'s do the labor for cuz we had no say on what was being grown there and she would throw a big fit if we even asked if we could have something specific, she was controlling and manipulative. She even had me sign up for a boarding school and an art school that you have to test into because she thought that\\'s what was best for me. I got accepted into both and chose to go to the boarding school because it lined up with the career path at that point that I wanted to do which was to be a geneticist. Eventually they started online schooling and I started attending classes, on the computer, they were supposed to go to the school early in quarantine so that we could live in the dorms but they decided it was too risky, I really wish they had just done their initial plan because I might have been in a different place in life than I am now if they had. My classes were okay they weren\\'t necessarily hard but they weren\\'t easy either they were challenging and I somehow managed to maintain an A and all of my classes and before we left Ohio I had maintained and 3.9 GPA even though I missed a lot of school. The only class that I was having a hard time with in this boarding school was physics but that was because the teacher never posted any lessons or held Zoom meetings all he would post is the test for the unit. I emailed him I sent him messages and all sorts of stuff but never got a reply for him so I entered tutoring but they couldn\\'t help me because I didn\\'t have notes. I reached out to a counselor and asked them for what I can do and they sent an email to the teacher who ended up not responding and I was starting to fail than one of the requirements for this school was if you had a d for longer than a month they would kick you out. My grade in that class at this time was an F. And I got a letter from the art school that I had applied at which had an IB program that I was forced to apply for from my grandma saying that I needed to either start attending classes or they were going to drop me and this is where I made the hard decision in my life. I chose to switch from this boarding school to the art school. But what i didnt know at the timewas i should have just stayed at the bording school cuz i was about to be majorly screwed over by the school. For the IB Program one of the required classes is Tok or theory of knowledge but I didn\\'t know this because I had never wanted to do IB so I didn\\'t know I was missing a class. They started doing in person classes about halfway through the year and everything was fine until about a week from the school ending I got called down to the counselor\\'s office where they had an also invited my mother to give me bad news that I would have to leave their school because I didn\\'t have the required class and they didn\\'t have a summer school option for it. So due to their neglect and their mishandling of my schedule I ended up being kicked out of a school I didn\\'t even want to apply at. I had to start attending the public school in my area which was known for constant fighting and delinquent children my senior year of high school. I was completely isolated at this point and had no one. I had all my required classes as a senior finished except for government so I attended government in the morning and had three art classes and then left for the day around lunch. At this point my grandma ended up leaving my step Grandpa and getting a divorce so me and my sister my mom and my step Grandpa were all living together at this point and decided we needed a new home because when we were living up was too expensive. My mom ended up getting another boyfriend who will call Neil So that we would be able to afford any place that we needed because he made decent money. I can go into all the problems with her dating this man but I\\'m not going to because it only lasted probably about 6 months. We ended up getting a place that was pretty big and was relatively affordable but only if my mom\\'s boyfriend at the time would stay and like I said he ended up leaving so it soon became a matter of us getting evicted or us finding a way to earn money to pay his part of the rent. So I took it upon myself as the oldest child too get a full-time job even though I was still attending high school at the time. I was able to convince my government teacher and counselor to let me do online schooling. It\\'s an eight to six job without any breaks. I was 18 so they didn\\'t care whether I got a break or not. I love my boss and this is the job I\\'m currently working but because I worked so long everyday and for 6 days a week with no vacation time available I ended up being too tired to focus on school when I got home cuz I had ended up going to bed at 9:00 at a pure exhaustion I failed out of high school. It was only one class that I needed to do and very upset with myself but it was either that or be homeless. Eventually about September of 2022 our landlord decided he was going to be selling the house we were currently living at so we had to move before November. We looked at a couple houses in the area that we\\'re still near my job because I didn\\'t have a license at this point so it needed to be within walking distance so where I\\'m working. There was a quaint house probably about 20 minute walk from my job that was relatively affordable for three working adults and I chose that one as my pick and so did my grandpa. But my mom being selfish decided we are going to pick the house that is more expensive than the one we were living at previously which we already struggled with getting rent in purely because it was bigger and allowed her to \"keep all her stuff\". My mother is selfish is making me pay the difference is the new rent even though I paid over 1/3 of the rent in our previous house already and barely make enough to afford that so here I am. Finding myself in 2023 High School Dropout with severe depression, stunted mental growth, overworked and the only thing that keeps my family from crumbling while my mom proceeds to mentally abused me and my sister by manipulating us into staying ever loyal to her and I started realizing recently that she hasn\\'t been the best mother and she really only cares about herself. She\\'s still on drugs to the same and my sister has to go to therapy because of everything that\\'s happened and I silently suffered and pushed through even though I constantly think about how easy it would be to just end everything. I\\'ve had vivid dreams of me committing suicide, my boss has a concealed carry license and always has a gun on her and I\\'ve often found myself drifting off into a Daydream imagining myself grabbing the gun and just shooting myself. But I\\'m scared because I know how precious life is. Not scared dying itself but I\\'m scared of what\\'s after, I\\'ve never been religious but I always wonder if there\\'s a heaven or hell or if there\\'s reincarnation or if there\\'s just nothing I don\\'t know. It\\'s the fear of the unknown that scares me from actually going through with any of my morbid thoughts. And a perfect world if I were to die I would be reborn and to a life that is luckier than this one but like I said I\\'m scared and don\\'t have the guts to go through with it. I feel trapped and I\\'m lonely and I have no one to turn to because no one listens, no one asks I should say if I\\'m okay when I\\'m not. So I just go on suffering and I guess I will until eventually I either die in an accident or go on suffering and hope Someone Save Me from this. I\\'m not asking for advice on how to get out of this situation but rather do you think I\\'m valid for having these feelings or am I overreacting, or maybe is it my fault that I\\'m in this mess I don\\'t know...', 'Flair': 'Sadness / Grief'}, 'Post 4': {'Title': 'What I have to offer.', 'Text': 'TW: A general synopsis (rambling nonsense) of my life I guess, with the very negative things that entails.

But I have a fear of diagnosis because I worry I\\'m a hypochondriac, that\\'s just collecting issues to delegate the fault of my failure. \\nBut I also despise the thought of trying to blame anyone or anything else for my failure. I say my failure is 100% my fault.\\n\\nI am (technically) diagnosed with ADHD, Depression, Generalized Anxiety, and Bipolar Type 2. No I don\\'t know the logistics. I theorize that I have DID and Autism.\\nThe autism I have been trying to get a diagnostic assessment for but bureaucracy has been hampering that.\\n\\nI worry constantly that I am faking one if not all of these things, especially the undiagnosed ones, I do not want to take away from people who need those resources, but I also don\\'t know what else they could be, I do not take any self diagnosis lightly, and I constantly lambaste myself for potentially faking.\\n\\nI was the same way with depression before I was diagnosed, do with that what you will I suppose.\\n\\nMy father put stuff before the happiness and health of his family. Not in a malicious way, but in that he wanted the stuff, and the place for the stuff became my bedroom when he couldn\\'t leave it out in the open. If I got rid of anything he \"gave\" me, he would get very upset and throw a tantrum. He would always punish me (in a way I feel was) disproportionately to the offense. \\n\\nTo be entirely honest, I have only a few clear memories from the time of my first step mother, but I got sent to my room for saying what I was guessing was the swear that was bleeped on TV. I know this sounds silly, but I literally did not understand what I did wrong, I was making a guess at an obfuscated word, it didn\\'t make sense to me why some words were bad (arbitrarily). \\n\\nDuring what I would classify as my early childhood years, being 6-11 years old, I remember crying to myself at night a lot. Or being punished for something I can\\'t remember and crying in my room. Not the loud tears of a child wishing to get their way, but the quiet tears of despair. I remember crying when someone said I did something wrong, often hiding in a corner of my step grandmother\\'s house when we went over, just sobbing as quiet as I could do nobody could find me. \\nI remember hurting myself during those years, in ways nobody would notice. I remember being confused about the world and why I just couldn\\'t be right, Why I couldn\\'t help my parents get back together. How I blamed myself, and how I wasn\\'t normal for them not being together, how me being dead would make everyone happy.\\nI remember thinking about death. How it was scary, but how it sounded peaceful. I remember casting my mind forward trying to imagine a future for me, and never finding one. \\nI remember knowing that I had to put on a different face depending on who I was around, but that behind the faces was just a child who blamed themself for every bad thing since their birth. I remember thinking of myself as more of a group of people, before I had any concept of what that meant.\\n\\nI had my first therapist when I was 6, my parents didn\\'t know what exactly was going on, but they knew something was. \\nThat therapist was nice, a kind man named Art. He had these little pill bugs in a bottle he let me hold as long as I didn\\'t shake them. He used to ask me about the drawings I made of people, what they meant to me. He used to take me on walks to this creek by his office and just walk and talk. I remember one time we found this turtle shell, and he said that next time I came over, he would have it cleaned up and in his office. I don\\'t remember if he ever did. I don\\'t remember why I stopped seeing him. I don\\'t remember why I couldn\\'t keep getting help from him.\\n\\nThe problems didn\\'t go away after I got a little older and entered middle school, I just got better at hiding them, I seemed better to everyone, so I must have been better. I was angry, I didn\\'t like what puberty was doing to me but I didn\\'t know why. I grew sarcastic by 7th grade, and never stopped staring at my ceiling and crying.\\n\\nI was bullied all throughout school, in elementary i usually got in trouble for defending myself. I don\\'t remember too much, but I know middle school was bad. I remember noticing rapid shifts in how I behaved around people and wondering if I was insane. I remember being really angry. Angry at the world, angry at my parents, but most of all angry at me.\\nThe older I got the more often I would hurt myself, it just brought me a relief I couldn\\'t explain, I had no proper idea of what self harm was, I knew what cutting was, something with emos or something? I laughed about those who committed suicide, because I was jealous of them. \\nI remember standing up for myself and using my anger to hurt someone who hurt me.\\n\\nHigh School is a blur. I barely remember it, COVID hit spring break junior year and that was the end of any facade of mental health I had. I had my mom shave my head that summer and I cried, cried for a reason I couldn\\'t put into words. I always liked having longer hair, it helped me hide when I needed, and express myself when I wanted. But I never had longer hair for more than a month, it always got cut. \\n\\nI\\'ve always had an unhealthy relationship with food because of my parents, my father enabling and encouraging food addiction, and my mother willfully ignoring what I had no idea was called bulimia which had started when I was 13. \\nThat first year of COVID turned everything up to max. I was well on my second step mother at this point and had a 9 year old half brother from the first to boot. My new step mom encouraged me to lose that weight by fasting and exercising.\\n\\nI got on a high protein diet, ate almost nothing, nearly constantly ran myself to exhaustion, and began cutting almost daily. \\nAbout six months in, with online only school happening at the same time, my senior year no less, I started faltering. Not that I stopped my clear downward trajectory, I started to really feel it.\\nI looked how I had dreamed, at least in fat. I had constant urges to go deeper and do more when I cut just to chase the high, and I started having low iron. \\n\\nDuring this time I became more cognizant of the people in my head. A few of us agreed on some names, and to just try things out. \\n\\nIn the early hours of the 1st of January 2021 I cut the deepest I ever had, and began to freak out because I couldn\\'t stop the bleeding. Thankfully, I was in a server that was for self harm reduction and recovery at the time, and had someone tell me how to tourniquet it with a torn up shirt, and to run it under warm water when the blood soaked bits were sticking. I had a guy from my head playing Dr. House for me, making sure I didn\\'t fuck it up.\\nI stopped the bleeding. But I knew I needed to make a change.\\n\\nEvery week since I was 6 years old, I traded between parents every week, like that couldn\\'t get stressful. I was barely 18 at the time on January 19 2021, and had just met this guy online, but I knew I was going to kill myself if I didn\\'t go inpatient. So I did.\\n\\nI was inpatient for about a week, it was an interesting time for sure, not too much to get into except I didn\\'t die, and I wanted to go by a different name than the one I was born with. The pronouns would have to wait (they still are to a degree). \\n\\nI\\'m about to get into the fresher wounds, although it was a few years ago, this was a monumental moment of decisions. These next few months.\\nI began reducing harm etc etc, got e-sexually active with my online fellow self harmer bf. \\nThat went about as well as you would expect. In fact, it went worse than one might expect.\\n\\nAbout 2 months into the relationship, after I had already been emotionally attached, because I had a warped sense of what live is, he came clean about a bunch of lies, each one a deal breaker in their own right. The one that stings is that he was not 19 like he said. But 15 about to be 16. I was 18, a legal adult, and I had no interest dating below 17, and only barely okay with 17.\\n\\nBut I didn\\'t leave. I didn\\'t fucking leave. I felt disgusting and stupid, but I didn\\'t fucking leave. \\n\\nThis was after he had encouraged me to have random sex with guys as a way to \"practice\" for him. Which left me feeling disgusting, but I thought I was doing good for my 19 year old experienced boyfriend.\\n\\nHow fucking naïve I was. The one time my idiotic ass decided to say fuck it, I\\'m all in, was the ONLY TIME that it would have fucked me over this goddamn hard.  I still feel like an absolute dumbass, but I was being cared about as I saw it, so I just did what would get me more affection to fill the fucking gaping void of nothingness from my parents.\\n\\nI did what he wanted, I felt like I had no out. I was in the wrong wasn\\'t I? I wanted to off myself in a whole new way.\\n\\nNear the end of the relationship, about 6 months in, he started drinking and getting high and threatening to kill himself if I left. There was always the implicit threat, we were both suicidal before we met but were \"living for each other\". Makes me want to fucking vomit. \\nAll of this behavior led to severe trust issues (obviously) \\nI tried to OD, avoided inpatient that time\\n\\nNow the explicit threat was on the table, and my brain decided that the people we had couldn\\'t deal with it, and made a new part. A part that could not feel almost any sympathy or love. \\nThis new part, and the help of a side online fuckbuddy (that I had mutual feelings for, and was my age) got me away from my emotionally abusive and manipulative, now ex, may he rot in hell if he\\'s dead.\\n\\nFuckbuddy becomes boyfriend after some time, he actually cares, has been honest with me from the very start, and we have a lot of better things in common. He\\'s amazing and I feel like I don\\'t deserve him &lt;3\\n\\nNow BF (we\\'ll call him Lyle), moves to college, but I\\'m planning on getting through community college and then moving up to him. I go through a lot of psychiatrists because I can\\'t consistently attend sessions and don\\'t trust psychologists after a bad experience \\n\\nCommunity college falls through due to a bad medication that gives extremely heightened anxiety that gets me unable to function out of fear.\\n\\nTake time, go to helpful group therapy, start hrt, get off that med. Decide I\\'m going to move up this year because I can\\'t live at home without being a \"jump risk\". Getting a summer camping job goes well, a bit depressed but that\\'s normal, less self harm than ever, all great.\\n\\nStart going to school near him, we hang out and I sleep over on weekends, always chatting in DMs when not in person. \\nGet through the first quarter, have to ask dad for money, he does.\\n\\nRun through all of my savings paying for college, can\\'t motivate myself to get a job. Apply, nobody responds, don\\'t try harder. Lyle supplies the majority of money, pays for my food, says he likes providing.\\n\\nI can\\'t pay for school without a miracle this term. That takes any wind out of my sails, I\\'m falling behind. I love my classes but can\\'t find a way it\\'ll matter. Depression is really bad, been seeing a counselor, only does so much.\\n\\nHard to just live for someone else. I\\'m not living for myself.\\n\\nThe counselor I see says that my death would be a loss to the people I know, would know, and the local queer community because of what I have to offer as a person, I don\\'t know how much I believe that.\\n\\nIf I go quietly as I can, Lyle would certainly be affected, but I know he\\'s strong and could move on, I know not unharmed though.\\n\\nMy parents would probably feel sad, that\\'s whatever to me.\\nMy brother would be very sad... Idk\\nOnline friends would remember but move on\\nFriends from home but don\\'t respect me, I don\\'t entirely care\\n\\nThe \"queer community\" wouldn\\'t notice just one more suicide, shits bad, the news cycle keeps on chugging.\\n\\nThat\\'s where I\\'m at in life I guess.\\nNot sure what to do.\\nI really want to die.\\n\\nIf you got here, or just scrolled here, thanks for either reading this far or checking.

We lived Sister, Brother,  Me, Brother we had to live with our Mother because living with our  Father was not possible because of his Job. (no time)!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Our Mother was not a good parent. (i wont go much into detail)!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!One example why during all our time living with Mother she didnt allowed us to leave the House.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Unfortunately  we got used to staying indoors and didnt wanted to leave house anymore  anyway. We had a House with Garden but as the Years passed during school  years we moved to an arpartment with 3 living rooms!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I  think before (or after but not during) i went to Kindergarten.I went to  some kind of institue for children in my age, reasons unkown to me. (i  dont know for how long but i imagine not long because it would  contradict with Kinergarten adn School) i lived there through most  Weekdays. I remember when i threw something in the thrash i noticed a  bag of ice cream in the thrash bin. It was from a day ago and i felt  left out. (like i felt i wasnt missed)!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!It  wasnt all that bad though. My Mother may not have been a good Parent  but she still cared for us and loved us desipite her Issues. I also had  my siblings and 2 friends of my Mother that became like Uncle and Aunt  to us. (those 2 were definitely good and exemplary people btw, Both were  Booksmart and had respectable jobs).!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Of  course being Children we loved them because they brought snacks  everytime.

I was there since the first  year (as mentioned unlike my siblings) To put salt into the wound, they  removed the school year 1 through 3 meaning we were the last ones that  went to go through those years.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Another  issue that was caused because of those is that a student in year 1  would go into the same school as a student in year 10. As mentioned the  students were awful there and i got targeted by 2 people that were 8  years above me. Thanks to my mother they got expelled from the School  for good. (she took me to police and i had scars to proof it) It may  have been the reason class 1 through 3 was removed.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Well  i never was able to make a single friend in school all the 10 years i  spend there. By the time i was in the third grade i realised how bad the  situation is (not getting along with anyone because i dont join them  when they become destructive/chaotic/disrespectful towards teachers and  sometimes just sometimes even violent (not towards teachers).!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!It  made me a extremely joyless child and may be the reason why i am an  Introvert. I always acted mature, serious, quiet and expressiveless. I  only spoke when spoken to.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I  kept saying to myself. its alright ill make friends later in live. I  was wrong, turnes out making friends is the easiest during school years  not to mention its skill that has to be developed. I remember having  once overheard one of the teachers saying  that she is sad seeing me  always walking alone during the school break. I stepped in and told her  its fine, not only have i friends outside school but i enjoy being alone  during the break. (i lied with the friends part)!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I  was also the only one (i think form year 1 until the 6-7th year) in my  family that had to go into a \"after-school care\" (sorry, im not quite  sure if thats the correct term in english). People there were not  better. (one of older ones tend to become violent when the care takers  are not watching)!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Funny,  i was actually pretty good with learning, i was able to do schoolwork  multiple years above me or one year above me compared to an regular  school (was able to do schoolwork for an 5th grader from a normal school  when i was in 4th grade). I was espicially good in Math. (i learned  some math topics on my own)!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I  had bad grades but only because i skipped school alot. (unexcused  absence resulted in an automatic F) Not very \"mature\" of me but can you  blame me? It was horrible.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!My  Mother didnt cared much about us not wanting going to school. When i  was present and took on an school exam it was either an A or if it was  German B/C.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!(grammar was my weakness)!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!During  some years (6th-8th grade) sometimes we would go to an state academy to  learn something new. My Sister being older and went there before me  convinced me its not worth attending to and so i always skipped when we  would go there. But i decided to give it a try one time and decided it  is infact worth it. I always went there afterwards.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Though i think we went mostly to the Workshop there.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I  still remember how our Class Teacher picked me out during our visit and  put me into a \"normal\" Class with an Math Teacher teaching Geometry. to  watch (i dont know on what Education level precisely this class was)!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!During  my 9th year in School i had enough because we moved to an 1 room  arpartment couple months ago. And moved to my Fathers house with my  younger brother (older siblings already moved out). We had finally had  space to breath if you know what i mean.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Father  still didnt had time for us but we were old enough now to take care of  ourselves. it was new territory for us though. Since the day i we moved  to my Father, i didnt had a single day being sick. It was noticable in  my last year in school because it was literally a 0 on excused and  unexcused absence on my school certificate for the 10th grade.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Well  during the 10th a class has to take a intelligence test. In half of the  categories i go average and the other half above aferage. (compared to  normal 10th grade students). You should have seen her confused face when  she asked why i was on this school haha....ha..!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Oh  by the way i learned English on my own because i thought the English in  the school was laughable. (no seriously i bet i was just filler) This  also explains why my English is not that good. (Not to mention the  atrocious German accent)!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Finally  i thought my live can start but i was wrong. Not only did i had never a  answer to the question \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" I had  literally no clue what to do next. So i got in contact with the Federal  Institute for Employment (Arbeitsagentur) and they send me to an  theory-reduced Vocational education because i went to a special school.  (wont say the profession but it was very monotonous)!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Since i didnt know what to do i took the offer and spend my 4 years learning it.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!During  those 4 years. My Mother changed alot, she became much better as a  person and parent. We always loved her but now she is bearable and it is  nice to spend time with her.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!The  Friend of our Mother (the one who was like an Uncle to us) died. My  last conversation with him was about me doing the education and he was  happy for me.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!(He died in the Hospital because of an accident)!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I  thought i wasnt allowed to take a day free because i wasnt blood  related for the funeral.

He gave me his  condolences and let the workplace know.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!He  told me i have the right to report sick which i knew but told him i  didnt wanted to. \"How would it look if i were to miss on my first day?\" I  said. He was impressed and told me he saw people skipping work just  because they dont feel like to.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Well i was able to complete my work and not miss a day.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!When i was done with the comapany i had a last day at the measure for an interview and saying goodbye.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!During the interview i got asked basic questions and other questions.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Do you have or had a relationship?

I was able to do  Sudoku and do difficult (just + and - tho) math questions. And how mad  and sad she was when she heard i was sent to a Special School for people  with the disability in learning. And i finally learned the reason why i  got send there. Even though i was an intelligent i had some speech  problems.

I was young and shitty and showed my friend as my cousin had shown me, to this day I don\\'t know why I showed her- I didn\\'t have anyone to tell it to, it had to feel real, someone had to see my suffering for it to mean something. Someone in my class saw it, they reported it to the school counselor and next thing I know I\\'m being called down in class, she sits me down and talks to me for a little bit and then says she needs to tell my parents, she asked \"do you want to be here when I call or do you want to go to class?\" I said I wanted to go to class- I somehow got lucky and she never called- I was called back into her office a couple times, I promised her I would tell my mom but I never did and she forgot about it. Thinking about it now I wish she told my mom, maybe I wouldn\\'t feel so alone now. Anyway, I stopped for a year after that, I didn\\'t want my family to check my body and see the act their daughter had done. The summer is going into 6th grade now, I cut again, this time was again with a razor, I liked it more that time. It was once. Here and there I cut sometimes on and off- most of the time with a thumb tack. 8th grade now and I loved a guy, yeah, a fucking guy. I loved him so much and i risked everything for him, all of my friends- all the relationships I have worked on my entire life. He broke up with me in, say October. The moment it happened my world had stopped, I couldn\\'t breathe I couldn\\'t think, I grabbed a rusty screw from the \"tool shelf\" and I went into the bathroom, that time I had cut more than I ever had, one after another, deeper and deeper. I wanted it to end, I didn\\'t want to feel like this over some guy. My friend called and she helped me stop for a little while so I could be okay for the rest of the day but I wasn\\'t, I cut with the screw for about a day, then I moved on to a razor I found once again. I joined Twitter to post pictures of my self harm and to talk about it, so once again I could know I wasn\\'t doing it all for nothing, so maybe someone, anyone could see and help me. No one ever did of course, not anyone on the internet or my family, they didn\\'t know though, I hid it well. I found blades everywhere, I remember coming back from Christmas break and seeing him in my class, right in front of me, taunting me. I had a casket-shaped pencil sharpener I loved, my mom gave it to me for my birthday, it was genuinely one of my favorite things I have ever gotten. I went to the bathroom and I took it apart and cut myself with it, more and more. I did this each day and everyday to stop whatever was going on. I thought better cut then not even fucking breathing- at least my parents would be happy they still had their little girl. It didn\\'t stop, I did it for months on end until I couldn\\'t see my pale skin anymore. I took photos, I posted photos. I liked it, I liked it a lot, it became, \"home\" everything about cutting at that point was so real, like the only real thing I had. I liked the hurt, and I liked the addiction, I didn\\'t want help, I didn\\'t want to get better. I wanted to fester in the blood and tears until someone found me. That happened for so long, it got better at some point near the end of the year. I started going to therapy, thanks to me texting my mom about it while cutting on the toilet, she didn\\'t know, of course- but it is the thought that counts. Therapy helped a lot, I started to try to stay clean, it was only a couple days at first, but then it with months. I was really proud of myself, things were getting better. The smallest things made me cut though, I had lots of fights with my friend, this is when I would sneak off in the bathroom and cut- but she didn\\'t know about it, and I wasn\\'t going to tell her- but she knew. She knew I never stopped, and she tried helping- and I know I was wrong for putting her in my shit, so I tried to hide it. On and off, I was sober, then I wasnt, I wanted someone to help me so bad- I just wanted someone to tell me that it\\'s going to be okay and I will get the help I need. I tried to kill myself 2 times, the first time I tried to drown myself, stupid I know. The second time I cut my arms, not deep enough bc of such a fucking coward I am but, I tried. Neither of them worked obviously and I kept going. On and off and on and off and to were I am now, still on and off but more off then on, I cut some days, and I don\\'t not think about it a lot, but I am getting better- things get better even if they don\\'t ever really get better. Addiction is a confusing thing, and different stages arnt forever, if you don\\'t want help now I\\'m sure you will later. Thank you, if you gotten this far for reading my story. I appreciate you, a lot. And I just want you to know your going to be okay, I\\'m noticing you, I want to help you.

Do therapists just not understand how hurtful ignoring emails can be?', 'Text': 'My therapist allowed email contact in between sessions as his sessions are not always regular due to disruptions in his/my schedule. I\\'ve emailed him many times in the past and he always replies back within a few days. We\\'ve spoken about this in person, about the boundaries regarding emailing etc. I always start off my emails by telling him that he doesn\\'t have to reply. This is something I\\'ve said to him in person as well, that I don\\'t need a proper response, that all I\\'m really asking when I email is \"are you still here?\", and a one or two word reply is all I need. \\n\\nThe past few months have been extremely difficult due to several things that happened all at the same time. He knows I\\'ve been struggling. I\\'ve also been having exams during this period, I\\'m still in the midst of exams. The things that have happened messed up my concentration massively and I\\'ve been struggling with trying to study. \\n\\nAnyway, I didn\\'t have therapy last week, and I emailed my therapist as I was having a very difficult time. I was basically having suicidal thoughts, losing hope, and feeling like a failure. It was a difficult email to send as I struggle with opening up to people, and the email included a lot of painful content. It\\'s been 9 days since I sent that email, my therapist still has not replied to it. I know that maybe it was because I told him he didn\\'t need to reply. He knows what I meant by that, we have talked about this in person, and he always replies to emails regardless. But I figured, maybe he had other reasons too.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried to rationalise it. I\\'ve told myself that there could be many reasons why he had not replied. He could have been dealing with emergency situations and just didn\\'t have the time. He could have forgotten or just not seen it. Or something else\\n\\nSo I sent him another follow up email 2 days ago to express my distress at his lack of reply... and to ask him if there\\'s a reason he didn\\'t reply. I told him that all I needed was one short sentence to know that he had received my email. He still has not replied. Even if he had reasons for not replying to the first email, I don\\'t know how to rationalise why he ignored my second email as well. All I was asking was one sentence. That\\'s all. Even if he didn\\'t want to discuss it, he could\\'ve told me that we should talk about in the therapy session. Unless his email was hacked and he didn\\'t receive the email, I honestly cannot understand why he would ignore my second email as well. I was very explicit about how distressing a lack of reply had been. \\n\\nBeing ignored is my biggest trigger, there\\'s nothing that causes me to go into meltdown mode faster than that. Not only does my mind run wild, it makes me feel like I don\\'t exist, like I\\'ve been annihilated in some way. \\n\\n I have a session with him tomorrow that I have now cancelled as I don\\'t want to see him again. He feels deeply punitive to me now. I know I\\'m splitting on him but I honestly cannot hold onto any image of him as a good therapist. I\\'m so disappointed and betrayed by what he did. I only have a few more exams left, I really needed to concentrate, and my concentration has already been racked by the other things that have been happening.... but what he did... it made me collapse completely. I have not been able to focus at all and I\\'m going to mess up my exams. I resent him for this. I know I shouldn\\'t blame him... but if I had known that he was going to be a source of pain, I would have never emailed him, especially in the midst of exams. \\n\\nI think I\\'m also withdrawing from him completely now... because I feel like I lost all power, all control with him. Even if he did have a good reason for not replying, I don\\'t ever want to feel so vulnerable and pathetic ever again. I don\\'t know if anyone can relate to this, but it felt like my life stopped while I was waiting for his email. I would look at my phone over and over again, willing for the email notification to pop up. I didn\\'t want to get out of bed, I became even more depressed as the days passed and he didn\\'t reply. It was as though I needed a reply... so I could breathe again and function again. It became almost obsessive, I was refreshing my email over and over again. I couldn\\'t focus on anything else. My mind was going crazy, from having panic attacks at the thought that maybe he had died, to feeling hated and rejected and ashamed for the contents of the email, to feeling resentful that he had robbed me of what little concentration I had left. \\n\\nI don\\'t want anyone to matter this way ever again. I\\'ve experienced this in my romantic relationships as well, and I hated being so dependent on someone else in this manner. Whenever I had arguments with boyfriends, my world would collapse completely and I wouldn\\'t be able to function at all. This is one reason why I have to stop therapy. I\\'m just done. I can\\'t trust him anymore, and I don\\'t ever want anyone to have this sort of power over my life again. \\n\\nDo therapists just not understand how it feels for patients/clients when we email them?? I asked him once how he responds if a patient gets triggered and sends multiple emails or something, he laughed and nonchalantly said that he just ignores them. If he doesn\\'t want to reply to emails, he just ignores them. His nonchalance bothered me even then.

I even played dragon balls games and fighting games even tho I don't like it. But I do it bcs I know they enjoy it. Bcs I love them. (and I obviously fake enjoy it I'm not stupid) \\nNow you'd think they'd ingage in my interest? No. Not once they'd propose to watch an abyss documentary, play my favorite games with me (which most are multi-player) ask about my interests or even watch the movies and series I like. \\nNo instead my favorite series get trash talked, smae for the games I like. And they don't listen when I talk about smth I'm exited about. Even the thing in their interest I like get trash talked. The fighting game for example (the guilty gear series) I took a big liking to a weird fella. First I found him visually appealing and I hot to his story and he's very compelling and I genuinely love him and his story. His game play is quite fun too (it's Faust BTW). The thing Is that apparently he's one of the worst characters to counter in the game so they all hate him. And as soon as I talk about him I get shushed and mocked. My gav game (which I plan to get a cover-up tattoo from bcs it's very dear to me) is constantly belittled.

Not even a hug or hand touch.

Bcs if they wanted the would. You're bad at remembering dates? Fucking put a reminder. This whole thing made me see that no one fucking care. If I don't organise the whole thing nothing happens. Even my birthday. I thought I could count on them but she was too far away and my bf missed his train. After I've organized so much events for them to be at a maximum there.

It made me a little bit uncomfortable, but I sorta just laughed it off,  and told him not to make any more jokes because although that one was funny, I don\\'t like other people joking about it. He said okay and everything seemed fine. Until we moved to the next machine and he starts making more jokes. Like;\\n\\nBrother: \"Oh [Name] I got excluded from school yesterday\"\\nMe: no you didn\\'t?? \\nBrother: yes I did, wanna know why?\\nMe: why??\\nBrother: because I told the emo girl to roll her sleeves up, slapped her wrist and said \\'I like your cut G!\\'\\n\\nAnd he kept on making all these jokes.

I couldnt stop looking at my arms, and i wanted to put my hoodie back on, but I way way too hot.\\n\\n A couple people near us started looking over because of how loud he was being. I got a few stares. After a while, I just couldn\\'t take anymore, so we left the gym early, and he continued on way home. He\\'s autistic.

He has a hard time telling when enough is enough, and how far is too far. \\n\\nSo I tried to talk very gently with him so I didn\\'t upset him, and explained that dark humour is when you joke about your OWN experiences to make the feelings behind them feel less difficult to manage, and that it makes me uncomfortable that he\\'s joking about self-harm and suicide when he\\'s actually never experienced any of it, and that joking about self harm makes me upset. He said he didn\\'t intend to, it was just dark humour, and he knows it was probably triggering so he\\'s sorry. I said it was okay, and just not to do it again. He said he wouldn\\'t. \\n\\nBut then when we were almost home, he made a joke about an emo kid and a tree- something about hanging I don\\'t remember what it was, just that it made me feel bad.\\n\\nAnd It just upsets me a little because this isn\\'t the first time he\\'s done this. Like a while back there were these tiktok slideshow videos with really creepy images, and I have a history of Psychosis. I warned him about them, telling him to avoid them, and then a couple days later, He calls me over and shows me his phone.

It ended up triggering a week long Psychosis episode, which was fun (not). And he would also send them to me randomly, because, and I quote; \\'he found them funny.\\' And I know he doesn\\'t do this stuff maliciously, it might seem like it, but trust me it isn\\'t malicious. I don\\'t think he intends to upset me as much as he does. I just don\\'t know how to explain to him how triggering these self-harm jokes are to me, as someone who\\'s struggling to get clean from self harm. \\n\\nI mean I\\'m a week clean now, and boy has that been hard. I\\'ve found that painting what I want to do to myself helps a bit. Capturing the pain that I\\'m feeling in a painting often helps to redirect these feelings into the painting, but there\\'s been nights where I\\'ve just sat there, holding the thing I use to hurt myself and just sobbing because of how bad I want to do it. \\n\\nSo if anyone has any advice on what I can say to him to get him to stop, (preferably without making him feel guilty.

The Young Man Who Was Afraid  \\n130:6.1  (1437.1) While they were up in the mountains, Jesus had a long talk  with a young man who was fearful and downcast. Failing to derive comfort  and courage from association with his fellows, this youth had sought  the solitude of the hills; he had grown up with a feeling of  helplessness and inferiority. These natural tendencies had been  augmented by numerous difficult circumstances which the lad had  encountered as he grew up, notably, the loss of his father when he was  twelve years of age. As they met, Jesus said: “Greetings, my friend! why  so downcast on such a beautiful day? If something has happened to  distress you, perhaps I can in some manner assist you. At any rate it  affords me real pleasure to proffer my services.”  \\n130:6.2 (1437.2)  The young man was disinclined to talk, and so Jesus made a second  approach to his soul, saying: “I understand you come up in these hills  to get away from folks; so, of course, you do not want to talk with me,  but I would like to know whether you are familiar with these hills; do  you know the direction of the trails? and, perchance, could you inform  me as to the best route to Phenix?” Now this youth was very familiar  with these mountains, and he really became much interested in telling  Jesus the way to Phenix, so much so that he marked out all the trails on  the ground and fully explained every detail. But he was startled and  made curious when Jesus, after saying good-bye and making as if he were  taking leave, suddenly turned to him, saying: “I well know you wish to  be left alone with your disconsolation; but it would be neither kind nor  fair for me to receive such generous help from you as to how best to  find my way to Phenix and then unthinkingly to go away from you without  making the least effort to answer your appealing request for help and  guidance regarding the best route to the goal of destiny which you seek  in your heart while you tarry here on the mountainside. As you so well  know the trails to Phenix, having traversed them many times, so do I  well know the way to the city of your disappointed hopes and thwarted  ambitions. And since you have asked me for help, I will not disappoint  you.” The youth was almost overcome, but he managed to stammer out,  “But—I did not ask you for anything—” And Jesus, laying a gentle hand on  his shoulder, said: “No, son, not with words but with longing looks did  you appeal to my heart. My boy, to one who loves his fellows there is  an eloquent appeal for help in your countenance of discouragement and  despair. Sit down with me while I tell you of the service trails and  happiness highways which lead from the sorrows of self to the joys of  loving activities in the brotherhood of men and in the service of the  God of heaven.”  \\n130:6.3 (1437.3) By this time the young man very much  desired to talk with Jesus, and he knelt at his feet imploring Jesus to  help him, to show him the way of escape from his world of personal  sorrow and defeat. Said Jesus: “My friend, arise! Stand up like a man!  You may be surrounded with small enemies and be retarded by many  obstacles, but the big things and the real things of this world and the  universe are on your side. The sun rises every morning to salute you  just as it does the most powerful and prosperous man on earth. Look—you  have a strong body and powerful muscles—your physical equipment is  better than the average. Of course, it is just about useless while you  sit out here on the mountainside and grieve over your misfortunes, real  and fancied. But you could do great things with your body if you would  hasten off to where great things are waiting to be done. You are trying  to run away from your unhappy self, but it cannot be done. You and your  problems of living are real; you cannot escape them as long as you live.  But look again, your mind is clear and capable. Your strong body has an  intelligent mind to direct it. Set your mind at work to solve its  problems; teach your intellect to work for you; refuse longer to be  dominated by fear like an unthinking animal. Your mind should be your  courageous ally in the solution of your life problems rather than your  being, as you have been, its abject fear-slave and the bond servant of  depression and defeat. But most valuable of all, your potential of real  achievement is the spirit which lives within you, and which will  stimulate and inspire your mind to control itself and activate the body  if you will release it from the fetters of fear and thus enable your  spiritual nature to begin your deliverance from the evils of inaction by  the power-presence of living faith. And then, forthwith, will this  faith vanquish fear of men by the compelling presence of that new and  all-dominating love of your fellows which will so soon fill your soul to  overflowing because of the consciousness which has been born in your  heart that you are a child of God.  \\n130:6.4 (1438.1) “This day, my  son, you are to be reborn, re-established as a man of faith, courage,  and devoted service to man, for God’s sake. And when you become so  readjusted to life within yourself, you become likewise readjusted to  the universe; you have been born again—born of the spirit—and henceforth  will your whole life become one of victorious accomplishment. Trouble  will invigorate you; disappointment will spur you on; difficulties will  challenge you; and obstacles will stimulate you. Arise, young man! Say  farewell to the life of cringing fear and fleeing cowardice. Hasten back  to duty and live your life in the flesh as a son of God, a mortal  dedicated to the ennobling service of man on earth and destined to the  superb and eternal service of God in eternity.”  \\n130:6.5 (1438.2) And  this youth, Fortune, subsequently became the leader of the Christians in  Crete and the close associate of Titus in his labors for the uplift of  the Cretan believers.  \\n130:6.6 (1438.3) The travelers were truly  rested and refreshed when they made ready about noon one day to sail for  Carthage in northern Africa, stopping for two days at Cyrene. It was  here that Jesus and Ganid gave first aid to a lad named Rufus, who had  been injured by the breakdown of a loaded oxcart. They carried him home  to his mother, and his father, Simon, little dreamed that the man whose  cross he subsequently bore by orders of a Roman soldier was the stranger  who once befriended his son.

Just trying to share my story in hopes someone else can relate and see a light at the end of the tunnel. \\n\\nThis is the first time I have ever made a post like this so I will try to keep it in tune with the 100’s of other great posts on this app from people just like me and probably the person reading this as well. \\n\\nStory time…\\nWhen I was 18 I went through a drastic change of being a high level successful athlete to throwing it all away since college was the first time I had true freedom. I lost my athletic scholarship due to drinking and making terrible decisions. Little did I know, the acceptance of this and my mistakes, is what would drive me to be successful. I moved home and into an apartment with a friend. After years of a strict diet, no alcohol, and 2-3 hours of exercise a day…my lifestyle changed to fast food, copious amounts of alcohol (never dabbled in any drugs other than weed and alcohol), little sleep, and little to no structure in my life. My first anxiety attack came when I was hanging with some friends on a 3 day beer drinking bender and a buddy got into a fight. My adrenaline went through the roof… I woke the next morning with the most intense feeling of anxiety, felt like I hadn’t slept in weeks, heart racing with palpitations, pounding head (probably the hangover), and an overall since of my life was going to end at any moment. I immediately called my family (very blessed to have had a close knit family I could count on). My mom struggles with anxiety as well and could some what relate to what I was feeling. I went to their house, crying my eyes out worried something was wrong with my heart and that I was dying. The next day I told my friend I had moved in with a couple months earlier that I was moving back in with my parents. For a week I slept in the hallway next to my parents room (pretty weak for an 18 year old who has done martial arts his whole life…I know) that way if my heart did stop I felt like I could somehow let them know. during this week I was checked out by several doctors. Every thing came back that I was healthy as could be. Blood tests, ekg, stress test, etc. I literally thought I was going insane. My doctor prescribed me a low dosage of celexa (10mg) and said it would help. It did…for a short period of time. After I jumped from 4 jobs in 6 months I finally landed a low level sales position. I quickly rose to the top and was promoted. At 20 I was making 6 figures, but still was struggling daily with anxiety that was not only related to health issues but now also that I would never be enough in my career, being controlling of any relationship, and fear of failing. I tried everything and what was the biggest help was once again gaining my relationship with God. Each time I started to pull away my anxiety would come back like crazy. I got back into binge drinking, and every time a hangover set in I was sent into a spiral of anxiety for days. At one point I went to the dr again and my blood pressure was through the roof. What did they suggest you might ask? What 90% of them do…more pills. That’s when I truly realized my doctor didn’t give two shits about my true health and only cared for a quick fix. I never took the pills and never upped my dosage of celexa. I started working out and made a career change that bettered my career and no one else’s. I quit looking up to those guys who seemed like they had it all together but deep down they hate themselves. For me, binge drinking was the biggest culprit. I had to accept the fact that my body does not react like everyone else. My anxiety did not hinder me from being successful, but I often thought if I didn’t have to deal with this…how much more could I truly accomplish. I am still struggling but I do finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. For anyone young and trying to make something of themselves, the biggest piece of advice I have is to find something bigger than yourself and trust in it (for me it was my faith). Don’t be so damn hard on yourself…we are human and we make mistakes, you just have to guide yourself to learn from them and keep rolling. Overtime if you focus on accepting that the anxiety is there and instead of fighting it you learn to roll with the punches. Accept that every bodily sensation does not have to mean something serious. Trust that the tests are real (even though the dr that tested you wants to give you medication to mask the symptoms) Try to make a goal for yourself and hit it head on. Find a friend, someone you trust, or a great therapist and talk to them about what you’re feeling. Be open about it. We try to make everyone feel like our life is perfect…the crazy news is…no one’s is perfect. We all have our own problems. With anxiety we just think we have to solve them right now in that very moment. LET IT GO! \\n\\nBelow is a list of the things I have felt, that never turned into anything.\\n\\n-Heart palpitations/racing heart \\n-Any bruise I would ever get from being active I thought it was due to some underlying disease \\n-literally anything and everything on my body feeling like a spasm or twitch involuntarily\\n-excessive shaking\\n-highly reactive to caffeine if I was already stressed out\\n-feeling like my blood pressure was too high (literally a panic attack/anxiety setting in)\\n-eye twitches\\n-can feel my heartbeat at any given time (obviously from focusing on it)\\n-freaking out when my skin would change color (I have turned red during any type of exercise my entire life and I have lighter skin that changes color when I’m cold…completely normal)\\n-the normal sense of impending doom\\n-feeling like I’m out of control with anything in my surrounding (the big one)\\n-feeling like my eyes aren’t adjusting to light and dark fast enough\\n-feeling like I’m seeing fuzzys in my vision\\n-feeling like my head is going to explode from something that is not a headache (tightness)\\n-random parts of my skin feeling extra sensitive to touch\\n-feeling like my temple is twitching or has pressure around it\\n-feeling like I’m here presently but not mentally (brain going a million miles an hour)\\n-feeling like a can’t get a deep enough breath \\n-feeling like at any time I will just drop dead for no apparent reason\\n-scared of any disease and the unknown \\n\\nThe list goes on and on and on.

This in and of itself is should be a major realisation: the personality changes that you see in yourself are what would happen to anyone for who this mental health issue becomes activated (and everyone has them in their DNA). For example, if you have generalised anxiety disorder (meaning excessive and uncontrollable worry all the time), one of the personality changes there is that you become chronically irritable: even small stuff can really trigger you or annoy you. Therefore the next necessary step is finding out what the characteristic changes in thinking and behaviour are that come with the mental health disorder and really doing this thoroughly. For example for social anxiety disorder, the most defining characteristic there is fear of negative evaluation from other people. I recommend writing down all the symptoms/characteristics changes associated with a certain mental health disorder somewhere in a notes app on your phone so you have them with you at all times.\\n\\nFinally, to make this work in practice you need to develop a 24/7 awareness of what you think, how you feel and what you do.

People adjust to their way of thinking, feeling and behaviour and it quickly becomes a new normal for them, they think they are their thoughts, feelings and behaviour, while they are just characteristic changes that are part of a mental health disorder. For many people worrying is just normal, and it becomes their way of living; same with their negative thinking, they think everything they believe is the truth (all the negative beliefs they hold), and do not realise their specific thoughts, actions and feelings (the water) are normal symptoms or byproducts of specific mental health disorders.\\n\\nDeveloping this 24/7- level awareness of what you think, feel and do, and always associating them back with a symptom/personality change with a mental health disorder may sound like a daunting thing, but I think it can go rather easily and smoothly once you make the switch.

reply to a comment on a post i saw from earlier (post about how certain are you that you actually have this diagnosis and you are actually bipolar) (the comment was about how the commenter had a friend that was diagnosed with bipolar due to one parent having it, thus bringing up the whole \"and its genetic\" discourse and what have you) and i just had too much to say so i am making my own post because i think it is valuable. anyways.\\n\\nit started off with me addressing the comment with this idea:\\n\\ni believe this happened (being treated for bipolar after a close family member was; thus the \"its genetic\" discourse) with my sister (F, high school age)... i (F, college age) got diagnosed and medicated starting about 2.5 years ago, after my first hypomanic episode and already existing severe depression.   then she (younger) not long after me identified too that she was feeling pretty depressed. it was suggested that she go to the same psych as me, one who specializes in bipolar, even though she hasn\\'t had a hypo/manic ep. now shes being medicated like she has because *I have had a hypomanic episode* and *i am being medicated for this /am*, which is \"because bipolar is so genetic\" and \"this is just preventative\" is what they say but idk *why* my sister is on 2 mood stablizers when tbh she has \"regular\" depression and anxiety. whats weird is that the psych STARTED her medication journey by putting her on lithium. and lamictal. idk, it feels kind of extreme to me and stresses me out when i think about it and shes just in high school!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nanyways, back to my experience with medication (that I\\'m sure some people relate to because I refuse to believe i am alone in this)\\n\\nfor me, i was medicated for depression for a year before my hypomanic breaking point, on various SSRIs and an SNRI (i was in highschool at this point). i went through a really disastrous breakup with a partner that was really shitty to me, and that left me so low that i needed a higher treatment and i started going to a partial hospitalization program for a month instead of school hours. when i got out, i was still pretty unstable, but had to go back to school, and not even a week later, COVID hit and lockdown began. so i was stuck in also a pretty toxic home environment. a few months later, i got hypomanic, i was so on edge, angry, argumentative, my only outlet was walking on the trail by my house, and i walked miles and miles each day.  my IOP therapist suggested that i could be bipolar after this really abrupt change in my mood, in addition to me starting to feel unsafe with myself and she even talked to my parents about me going to inpatient. i ended up not going (mainly due to covid)  and instead started seeing the psychiatrist i mentioned earlier, the one that specializes in bipolar. she put me on a heavy anti-psychotic which really helped me come back down. from there it was trying to figure out the best treatment plan for me. i felt like an experiment and i tried so many different meds/combos of meds and i just was so angry and frustrated that my life had come to this where i had take medications every day in high doses that i knew nothing about. i mean, wouldn\\'t that bug anyone?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nyes, i wanted to believe that this was all too much and that i wasn\\'t actually bipolar. i was \"fine\". this is still a common struggle for me. i wasn\\'t taking my meds reliably and i felt the disappointment of my parents from doing so and from my psychiatrist who just kept telling me \"i cannot help you or treat you if you do not take your meds as directed and regularly\" (fair). ultimately my parents staged an intervention, and it was like a whole family effort to get me to take my meds. i ultimately did (and proudly have not missed a dose in 2 years)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\njust as i was in the beginning of my med journey, i am just stuck between feeling like i should have control over my body, be autonomous, make my decisions, especially medical ones, because being heavily medicated is felt in your body (ie it takes its toll) and it felt like i was losing myself and only doing this for the people around me (who didn\\'t understand me anyways).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nevery night i remember that i am mentally ill.\\n\\nevery day and every night its like taking a handful of pills, every night while your partner is in bed already, *waiting for you to come to bed*, and you have to say \"in a second\" every night.  just keep swallowing them because its bedtime and you have to take your meds.\\n\\nthis is an invisible struggle that not a lot of the people see, most often the ones *telling us to take our meds* or the people or family or doctor or friends who *make it seem like an easy solution,* or *that it\\'s not that big of a deal considering the overall benefits!* all have no idea how *exhausting* it is, because those people don\\'t think about how you have been medicated now for 3 years. 1,095 nights of swallowing 3 tablets of lithium, one of lamictal, one of prozac, and one of caplyta.\\n\\nit happens every day. it is a chore every day. it reminds me *every day* that i am bipolar, different than most other people in my life. it is a reminder that not only am i different, i have to sacrifice part of my autonomy to be \"normal\".\\n\\nand when i think \"what if im not actually\" i envision those people. those people who don\\'t know what its like to take that many pills *every night for the past 1,095 nights,* and they certainly don\\'t know what its like to have to envision the tens of thousand more nights of your life, all ending in the same way and *you cant do anything about it*.\\n\\nstopping meds is not an option and you know you just have to keep swallowing the pills, on chistmas, on thanksgiving, on your birthday, on the last Tuesday of july, WHATEVER day it is, YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR MEDS THAT NIGHT. how are you not supposed to get tired of this? how are you supposed to come to terms with it, especially when you can\\'t not think about it because its in your face every night?\\n\\ni have to silently cope with the \"what if I\\'m not actually bipolar\" thoughts, manage them myself, and if i did choose to be autonomous, if i did decide to \"take matters into my own hands\", if i did stop taking my meds, that is scary. that is scary because if it did go wrong, if i did have a worse reaction, i would then have to cope with if i AM actually bipolar, in addition to going back on my meds, i would have to deal with the side effects all over again. i would have to tapper back on. i would barely be getting over the withdrawal symptoms, and my brain would be filled with shame, guilt, and embarrassment, the \"i told you so\\'s\", and the fact that maybe just in my logical brain, knowing that i could have prevented this. knowing that its for real this time, i have this disorder, i have to accept it, knowing my nights will be ending this way for years and years and years. knowing that i have to show up *every* night for the *rest* of my years.\\n\\nstarting the process over is not an option because that would be worse than anything i am thinking about now because of what would happen if i decided i wasn\\'t bipolar, had i given into the thoughts.\\n\\nit takes up real time in my life, a significant amount of time. every night. and it isn\\'t just swallowing the pills with a jug of water. its also knowing i have a psychiatrist appointment. a psychiatrist appointment in my calendar means that  i have to think about the fact that i have a psychiatrist appointment. i have to show up or tune into my psychiatrist appointment where my doctor asks me intimate details about my personal mental health (such as SI or SH or the things you are unproud of, etc, ya know), and i have to answer, recall that information, say it out loud, make it concise enough to know that i am giving her the best representation of my moods in the last 6 fucking weeks, or am i? oh, what if i am making this up? what if i am doing this all for some kind of attention? what really is mental illness do i really have this?\\n\\nin my psychiatrist appointment, i have to hear what she has to say about what she thinks about such a small window into my everyday brain. what if she doesn\\'t truly get me, then is treating me wrong because i didn\\'t say it better, maybe i wasn\\'t honest enough. and i have to then accept and trust what she says, and oh i will see you in 6 weeks for this all over again! having a psychiatrist appointment means that i then have to schedule another. having a completed psychiatrist appointment means figuring out when i will go to the pharmacy. even after its done i have to think about how will this change the structure of the day, or if will this throw me off, trigger me even after i am left with the reminder of the worst parts of my last 6 weeks.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\ni have to carry this around every day and it is only allowed to exist in one of the back cabinets of my mind. i have to go back and find that cabinet every night, call upon it because i have my jug of water, its 11 pm and its almost time for bed.\\n\\nand my partner is still waiting for me , already in bed, loves me anyway and without questions. its not about not

burdened with the cabinet contents they are now aware of, because to them, why is it even a big deal to take meds, to \"fix\" the problem? to them its \"you have the ability to fix this problem you

I\\'m also thinking about my friend who has bipolar too, who really gets it. they stopped their meds, lost the silent battle, had a terrible reaction with severe symptoms, they didn\\'t tell her parents about it because she know she would get rejected (she did), they wouldn\\'t understand (they didn\\'t), she knew she was going to be stigmatized (they were), and was so conveniately served the \"i told you so\", \"it isn\\'t that hard\", \"how could you do this to us\" soup for dinner when she eventually told them. all this when they could have been understanding, they could have listened to her, given her kindness and support, devoid of the shame, guilt, and embarrassment, because *sometimes we are wrong*. a lot of people are wrong every day, and just because we are bipolar, doesn\\'t mean we don\\'t deserve to be treated like everyone else.\\n\\nour brains go against our smart decision-making, that\\'s just part of it. do you know how many times my therapist has said to me (kindly), please don\\'t stop taking your meds, even though you feel fine or like you don\\'t need them anymore. that alone tells me that this is not a struggle only i deal with, or only my friend deals with.\\n\\ni want to prevent this shame we feel.  i want to TALK about it and i want to give people the space to talk about it too, because SOMETIMES its liberating and SOMETIMES it can help you stick to your treatment plan even though that voice from that cabinet is so fuckingggggggggg loud.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\ntldr: sometimes being in the bipolar world feels incredibly restrictive and heavy and makes me sad and those around me don\\'t quite get it.', 'Flair': 'Discussion'}, 'Post 2': {'Title': 'Getting family to understand this', 'Text': 'Alright, so feels like I\\'m stuck with a pretty common problem when it comes to family and getting them to fully grasp what\\'s going on with me.\\n\\nThe full story ended up being pretty long, because of venting, so it\\'s behind spoiler tags. The tl;dr explanations are pretty straightforward, so you can probably get the gist of it with those without having to read the whole novel.\\n\\n**Background:**\\n\\n&gt;!I was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder, or at least told by a non-psychiatric doctor that I most likely was, when I was 19. Went on medication briefly, but as is often the case, I didn\\'t want to accept the diagnosis, so I stopped. For about the next decade, I went through cycles of coming close to accepting the diagnosis and would start meds before inevitably backing away. Finally got officially diagnosed with bipolar disorder I about a year and a half ago and have been receiving consistent treatment since then.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!With me, I\\'m pretty much never in a base line state, so if I\\'m not in an outright depressive state, that means I\\'m probably either in a mixed hypomanic-depressive state, hypomania, or mania. I also do a lot of rapid cycling.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!The medication is still constantly being tweaked, however, and I haven\\'t found a regimen that really works for me and I\\'ve been having dosages tweaked as well as adding and removing entire prescriptions, so it\\'s all been pretty erratic and change has been pretty minor.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Additionally, my therapist unfortunately left my clinic in early December for a new job and was told that she wasn\\'t allowed to \"poach\" me, and I haven\\'t found a new one I get along with at this clinic, which is now very understaffed after she and another therapist left at the same time.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Obviously, between the hiccup in receiving regular therapy and the constant shifting of meds, this means the treatment for bipolar disorder isn\\'t making huge leaps and bounds. In fact, December was one of the  most difficult months I\\'ve had since the official diagnosis. The meds were causing intense side effects while not helping, and I was rapid cycling between deep depression and hypomania. !&lt;\\n\\n**The family problem:**\\n\\n&gt;!Prior to being diagnosed, they just thought I was a huge problem that was out to make life difficult for them. They were initially pretty supportive and, but I made the mistake of thinking that they fully understood what bipolar disorder was and the effect it had on me. Around June, I was in a fairly hypomanic state when I the first time since Christmas of \\'21, but in the happy, fun way, and not the ready to snap way. This made them think I was \"making progress.\" Between then and December, my meds changed several times, and I avoided seeing them specifically because I was worried that they were expecting my symptoms to have disappeared and that I would be instantly improved. !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!You can probably guess where this is going.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Eventually, Christmas comes around, and I figure I more or less have to see them after having skipped Thanksgiving as well as just not seeing them in person for six months. The plan was to visit them at my sister\\'s house for Christmas Eve, since she has two kids, and then do Christmas morning at my parent\\'s house, where I would stay the night. !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Unfortunately, I was feeling sick from side effects of a med I was taking, as well as stressed and anxious about how they were going to react towards me, which wasn\\'t improved by holiday traffic on an hour long drive to see them in heavy rain at night, so by the time I reach my sister\\'s house for Christmas Eve, I was in a bad mood. !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!But just a bad mood. Not mania, not hypomania. Maybe in a low-grade mixed state, but mostly just a bad mood. At least at first.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!As you can probably guess, that night and the next day were not great. As soon as they clocked that I was in a bad mood, the reaction from my mother and my sister was that I was already manic (I don\\'t think they knew the other two existed, so probably just that).!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I think most people here can agree how irritating it is to have people close to you always think that the only reason you\\'re in a bad mood is because of having bipolar disorder, but I did my best to not let it get to me, and was just trying to get myself to cool down.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!What did get to me was the way they then started acting. Basically, they started treating me like a ticking time bomb, and they were becoming irritated with me because they felt like they were having to deal with the problem of me and my disorder which they thought was on the way out. Things got progressively more tense over the night with pretty charged exchanges or bursts of irritation from both sides until I left my sister\\'s house to go stay with my parents for the night.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!My sleep schedule is pretty erratic is constantly shifting, so I was actually awake most of the night. At that point, between the lack of sleep and the stress of the night before, I was definitely tipping over into mild hypomania. At this point in my treatment, I can at least spot it happening, but obviously there isn\\'t much I can do about it other than just leaving. !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Christmas morning wasn\\'t too bad, but I clearly wasn\\'t in any better mood than I was before. Eventually, presents are opened, kids are happy, and I decide to go to bed again hoping that would fix my state of mind, and don\\'t wake up until around 5 or 6 PM.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!But while I was sleeping, I didn\\'t account for a few things:!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!1. They were likely discussing my mood.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!2. They were now stressed about Christmas stuff.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!3. They had been drinking the entire time.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I wake up to my sister and her kids jumping on the ceiling above me to wake me up. Which, fun fact! My most common psychotic hallucination is footsteps above me and loud banging/crashing noises. So I wake up abruptly (bad for anyone) and thinking I was entering psychosis.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!So by the time I get to the kitchen, I\\'m definitely in a pretty intense hypomanic-depressive mixed state approaching , which helped keep me very irritated at them; my sister, her husband, and my mother were \"tipsy\" (drunk), and it was clear immediately on walking into the kitchen that they were now fully expecting me to explode, which annoyed them because now I was ruining the day for them.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!The inevitable happens; things get testy and snippy, and it starts to build over the next hour or so, but not as badly as it could\\'ve. In fact, as soon as it was clear that I was going off, I self-regulated and left, which I saw as the right decision. They took it as me just being a huge problem as usual. Rest of the night for me was pretty much what you\\'d expect as well.!&lt;\\n\\n**Tl;dr - Being treated for bipolar I for a year and a half. Family thought I was an asshole before but that I was getting better after getting magic pills that make me \"normal\" immediately. I\\'m annoyed because of normal life reasons on Christmas, they think I\\'m about to have a bipolar meltdown from the moment I arrive, which nearly makes me actually have a bipolar meltdown.**\\n\\n**Aftermath:**\\n\\n&gt;!In my hurry to leave, I left an external SSD at my parents house. I then met up with my dad halfway between my house and his, and I figure I should just address everything on Christmas.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!He then confirms:!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!1. Yes, they thought I was going to be a problem as soon as they saw me in a bad mood.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!2. Yes, they weren\\'t happy about it and thought that it was inevitable. !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I then explained to him how I didn\\'t start off hypomanic or manic, I was just annoyed, and that them visibly acting like I was about to blow right from the start only threw fuel on the fire, which helped push me  until I actually was on the verge of a bipolar meltdown.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!He responds by saying that they were also stressed because of it being Christmas along with the usual stress of dealing with my sister\\'s kids, and that they were apparently \"trying very hard\" not to make me mad, and that they didn\\'t really understand why I was. They thought I was getting better.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I say that I understand that they were stressed, but that as soon as I started going from bad mood to mixed state and quickly to hypomania, I was incapable of thinking clearly, while they were. Most importantly, that the best thing to do in that situation would be to give me space and try to deescalate, but instead they responded by engaging and escalating. He seems surprised by this, and starts talking about how little he knows about it.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I then realize: I had assumed they\\'d read about what it was and how it worked, but they didn\\'t, and they had basically no clear what it actually was or how it works. So I had expected them to approach me with a better understanding of why I was acting one way or another, and what they could do to help.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Instead, they had just viewed it as a confirmation that I wasn\\'t just an asshole, but a medically confirmed asshole.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Now, I think I\\'ve got it. I explain everything I can to him about bipolar disorder I and how it affects my thoughts and emotions, the limits of medication, importance of communication, etc., and ask him to talk with my sister and mother. He agrees, and the next day, I call my mother, confirm she had talked with my father, and ask if she had any questions she wanted to ask me.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!She said no. Which I knew was... not a great sign. !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!I spend the next week thinking of how to approach it, and realize that I can\\'t do anything else with my family in person until we\\'ve got an understanding with each other. I find some articles that I think explain it fairly while also not making it seem like the entire burden was on them, and I call my mother last weekend to discuss it a little further and tell her about the articles.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!During the conversation, I do my best to stay calm and try to be helpful, but soon it becomes clear that my father hadn\\'t gone into enough detail or she just hadn\\'t absorbed it. Essentially, she says in a roundabout way that they were stressed, I should have not expected them to act more patiently or accommodatingly because of it, and instead, I should have not caused a problem by being moody and hostile. Also, why wasn\\'t I better yet?!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!So, petty clear by now that this situation wasn\\'t getting any less fucked no matter how I tried to explain it to them.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Regardless, I send the articles Sunday night, and she says she\\'ll read them as soon as she can. She finally reads two of them last night and emails me to tell me, and then asks what type I was diagnosed with. Good sign, she now knows there are types! Even though I had definitely already told her multiple times, but whatever.!&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!She then ends the email by out of nowhere asking if I had also been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!So... little to no progress has been made here. Planning on talking with her today, but I\\'m expecting it to be a rehash of her trying to suggest that I should give her lattitude when she\\'s stressed  now I have the added wrinkle of having to explain that no, I do not have BPD and have actually discussed personality disorders with psychiatrists and therapists, and hey, maybe don\\'t throw out other diagnoses unprompted at all since she\\'s not a psychiatrist or a therapist.!&lt;\\n\\n**tl;dr x2 - My family does not seem to be able to accept what parts of my behavior are down to bipolar disorder, that I\\'m physically unable to make my brain not be in a state that they find difficult to deal with, but I should be more accomodating to them when they\\'re stressed (which is fair, but possibly not doable depending on my state), and maybe most importantly, they\\'re exhausted by how I haven\\'t improved enough for them.**\\n\\nSo what do I do here?

It\\'s been great because basically from day one I noticed my anxiety in my work meetings reduce significantly. Over time it\\'s seemed to get even better. Of course as a Benzodiazepine the big worry is that it doesn\\'t take long for tolerance to build up, and the withdrawal symptoms seem terrifying on paper, so Ideally I think the hope is that the next medication on the list that takes longer to start working solves the issue for the long term so I can come off of the Clonazepam sooner rather than later, especially because its a schedule IV drug, which while legal because its been prescribed by a doctor to me for treatment of illness, still feels risky given you can get into trouble if someone else takes some off you etc etc. That being said, its effect started off mild and then became almost magical. Today after a scrum meeting I didnt go to lie down for half an hour. I needed no time to recover. I started back working basically right away. Before this, I had gotten to the point where I would say my piece and then lie down under my bed because hearing other people talk about their accomplishments from the previous day would make my anxiety more severe and this little dose of Clonazepam seems to have been enough to eliminate that. Its crazy.\\n\\nI still have some anxiety, serious anxiety even, but I don\\'t feel like suddenly quitting my job anymore.\\n\\nThe second drug is Escitalopram. This is a pretty typical SSRI, and since I\\'ve only been on it for a week, I can\\'t say too much. At least in the 1 week I\\'ve been on it though, I haven\\'t yet had a complete loss of function in my penis. I still seem able to get off, while my erection isn\\'t as hard as it typically is, it\\'s still functional, and while it feels a little bit desensitized (which is a bit of a problem for me because I\\'ve always been on the longer side of time to finish). Another side effect it has had is pretty extreme insomnia, where I\\'ve been having a hard time falling asleep, only to wake up again not long after getting around 2-3 hours of sleep the past few days. I\\'ve been advised to perhaps have it in the morning instead and so I\\'ll see if that works. I think it so far, it has been bearable otherwise. I really hope it works to help with some of the OCD tendencies I\\'ve started to build up I assume due to the anxiety. I also hope it works for the anxiety, but I\\'ll have to wait a few more weeks to really see if it\\'s helping. Hopefully it helps the depression too.\\n\\nThe last drug is probably going to be the biggest, and that\\'s Adderall XR. I actually held off for a few weeks even though my Psychiatrist offered it earlier because I was so afraid of the side effects, addiction, tolerance problems etc, but thus far, on my very meager dosage, it seems just fine. I actually don\\'t notice much with the 10mg he started me off on (he wanted to start at 20, but I was afraid so we started low). I notice no heart rate increase, no headache, no notable mood changes (maybe slightly less depressed and gloomy but that\\'s probably the anxiety), no dizziness or headache, and only a little bit of appetite loss, but I\\'m a big guy so that\\'s actually a really positive benefit. I out of curiosity after having had it for a few days and noticing nothing decided to double up my dosage to the 20 he had wanted to put me on before, and I can say it seems to already have started to work. I imagine I could still use a higher dosage still as the effect is very mild and I still have many issues, but I feel like I\\'m seeing real effects already with my ability to stay on task. I\\'m clearly not there yet, but I\\'m starting to be confident that this might be a great long term solution for me given that serious tolerance issues appear to usually take years to build up.\\n\\nI still haven\\'t been diagnosed with anything, which worries me because I fear that if I for some reason lose connection with them, I\\'ll need to start the process all over and have an abrupt stoppage, but at least right now its looking good.\\n\\nMaybe the Clonazepam saved me from the side effects, maybe its just really compatible with me, or maybe its the light dosage, but it seems fine so far and I only have hopes it\\'ll get even better. The psychiatrist has suggested I see them every 2 weeks to increase the dosage until I hit 50mg, or start running into side effects I can\\'t manage.\\n\\nI\\'m currently shopping around looking for a psychologist to hopefully accompany my medication as well and help me with both my anxiety, avoidance (nearly agoraphobia), social issues likely partially caused by that etc. Im looking at various profiles on different websites to try to figure out who I should contact first. I\\'ve had some bad experiences in the past with psychologists so I\\'m pretty hesitant and picky.\\n\\n* I\\'ve had a psychologist who seemed nice but due to government program restrictions I could only see 6 times, which was useless.\\n\\n* I\\'ve had a psychologist who told me I was \"a completely fucked up human being\", which had me in tears and a deeeeeeeeep depression for weeks (I think she thought that was tough love or some nonsense, but it was really unprofessional and damaging and in hindsight I should have reported her).\\n\\n* I\\'ve had a psychologist who I didnt last long with just because their buildings smelled awful, and like it had mold, the place looked like a mess and their furniture was old and ripped apart.\\n\\n* I\\'ve even had a psychologist who tried to push religion on me, which was not cool at all and I noped right out of that situation.\\n\\nIt\\'s really hard to know what you are going to get, and when I know my insurance will (I believe) only cover the first 1000 bucks per year, leaving me to probably pay thousands for this, it\\'s a hard pill to swallow given how much I expect to have to shop around.\\n\\nI\\'m still going to try it again though, and maybe my being more picky this time will pay off. I think ultimately if I find one that works, even if I have to spend 10,000 dollars to fix my issues it\\'ll be worth it.\\n\\nA few months ago my prognosis on life was dim. Like one bad event or bad enough day from being over dim.\\n\\nRight now, Its still dim, dark even, but I at least see a potential path to success (fulfillment and happiness) again. The destination still looks extremely far away, like years away even, but at least I see it; A chance to fix my life so that I can maybe enjoy the last 2/3rds even if the first 1/3rd has been horrible.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI was initially going to make this just a comment but figured I put enough in here that a post would be more relevant especially for discovery for other people, and to get opinions on what people think of my current plans to help my mental health.', 'Flair': 'Discussion'}, 'Post 4': {'Title': 'Difficult Morning = Curious About Universal Experiences and Symptoms', 'Text': 'Good morning, everyone\\\\~! From where I am, anyway. Just have a good one.\\n\\nI am currently having a massive anxiety attack. Information finding is my coping skill/obsession. I absolutely, 100% cannot stop myself from digging at something until I find out the \"why.\" Mostly because problems in my life keep popping up--severe ones, I might add--and this is how I survived. So, now in the more mundane situations, my brain has interwoven the anxiety and panic with repeated occurrences of mundane annoyances with extreme reactions (crying uncontrollably and ultimately suicidal compulsion). I do not want to rid myself of curiosity--it\\'s a fun, soothing activity to engage in. But, the more I find out, the more upset I get. Then it isn\\'t so soothing anymore. But, I can\\'t get rid of this trait either as it has really helped me survive on repeated occasions (like, feeling unsafe with my violent ex and methodically finding out all the information to support it which ultimately freed me from him but also scarred me further in the process).  \\n\\nIt is common to say, \"lower your expectations.\" Should I lower my expectations when I know that there is something that is causing me pain? Today, my apartment complex triggered me. I\\'ve had numerous problems from my apartment flooding with sewage, visible carpet tacks on the floor, and the complex\\'s fire alarm. Specifically, I am complaining about the fire alarm today. Over the last two years I\\'ve lived here, it has gone off numerous times with a high-pitched squeal. They tell me that no one but the company itself can turn it off and they aren\\'t open overnight--it\\'s not an emergency. I have migraines with aura. I lose anywhere from a quarter to three-fourths of my vision sometimes. It\\'s sound and light sensitive. Yet, they don\\'t consider it a health emergency for the fire alarm which has a grounding fault that\\'s screeching for hours on end that\\'s causing my migraine. I also get nauseated with these. Previously, I vomit with my migraines (fortunately I haven \\'t had any of those episodes in a while...but I try to maintain quiet for exactly this reason). Hell, I don\\'t even listen to music that often. And I actually like bassy songs. I also have several other physical ailments in addition to my migraines that compound (e.g., fibromyalgia). \\n\\nI am honestly so tired of trying to explain that you\\'re triggering me. It\\'s exhausting to have to relive it over and over again. And on the flip side, they don\\'t know they\\'re triggering me. Then they\\'re triggered that I\\'m triggered. And then I panic. And then I cry because I don\\'t want anyone to be upset. I don\\'t want my head to hurt. How do you handle this post traumatic purgatory? I don\\'t want to be a Karen, but I feel like I have so many small complaints that have mounted into big ones. And I get treated less than human. I mean, I just asked for someone to stop the screeching. Anyone deserves that much, especially when there isn\\'t a fire. At this point, I\\'ve threatened to bring in the city and the fire department. But, I hate doing that. I really, really effing do. I hate crying. I hate being angry. I don\\'t care even if they would give me the key to turn it off, though I know they probably legally can\\'t. If they\\'d just give me some sort of agency instead of lauding their power over me. I want teamwork, but everyone thinks I\\'m not a team player even when I offer to do extra work (stuff that I really honestly shouldn\\'t have to do since it\\'s supposed to be covered in my rent). I always, always ask nicely first and offer to help in anyway I can...and then I end up just a mess because they think I\\'m being a straight up asshole. I don\\'t know what to do anymore. \\n\\nWhen it gets bad, it triggers my suicidal thoughts. I\\'m fine right now, and I\\'m with someone. Please don\\'t sic the bot on me. It\\'s almost PTSD-inducing in itself at this point. It\\'s just as hollow as someone saying, \"get help\" as if I haven\\'t already. Sometimes I wonder if the neurological connections are so ingrained I\\'ll ever be able to work again. Simple situations like this cause me to spiral, and companies are not sympathetic to break downs just because you\\'ve asked a lot nicely and still didn\\'t get what you needed to do your job. Corporations don\\'t care, and I shouldn\\'t. But that\\'s not how my PTSD works. I\\'m so sick of it.  I\\'m so isolated from it too.  I have no one to talk to about it because I\\'ve had numerous therapists tell me that I only have depression. After reading this subreddit, the numerous scientific articles on CPTSD, and my degree, I\\'m certain I have it. I\\'m able to pinpoint exactly why I react the way I do and I also recognize that some of my memories may be false. For example, my grandfather dying and coming back to life at the morgue. I honest to god can\\'t remember if that happened or not. I do remember that he laid down and seemingly died from his COPD on the face-down on the floor. I remember him surviving that and having to go to work still a month after my grandmother died. Then he did it again and didn\\'t make it. This memory is probably true, and I know I\"ve had nightmares about the fake memory. But it\\'s so real and close to the real memory, I actually get distressed about remembering it incorrectly. And there are numerous other examples of this. Most of the time, therapists shrug their shoulders and say that\\'s weird. YEAH. IT\\'S A SYMPTOM. I also have undiagnosed OCD (terrible skin picking, to the point of freely bleeding nailbeds, an obsession with suicide that I just recently acknowledged...I just don\\'t know. It\\'s so hard to get around therapists preconceived notions that they know better despite speaking to an educated patient. I educated myself so I could get the right treatment. So I could break free. I wasn\\'t doom scrolling. \\n\\nI guess this became a rant, but it\\'s kind of a discussion and question. I really would like to know your tips and tricks on dealing with fact-finding compulsions. I can\\'t move on until I read about my problem and figure out a solution, and then I become so disenamored when I don\\'t have the power to test my solution. My doctors hate this about me. Anyone who comes into contact hates this about me. I feel so alone anymore, especially after my family died. I alienate people, and people alienate me. My friends shut down emotionally and started calling me mentally ill every time I requested that we not go out into the pandemic and eat at restaurants (my mother died from COVID, and I got super sick too). They wouldn\\'t talk to me, but said they were my best friends and family. To someone who has no family, that meant so much to me. But then they wouldn\\'t talk to me, like go months on end without messaging. My happiness isn\\'t their responsibility, but they told me they were family and I thought that meant we cared about how each other was doing. It really makes me feel better when people act like they trust me, and they basically said that I was trying to find out information to sharpen my blade to use it against them. And that\\'s their trauma...and that\\'s when I realized that it\\'s so difficult to find people whose traumas play well with one and another. I\\'m so tired. I have my partner, and they understands me. I just don\\'t have anyone else and not for a lack of trying. I\\'m so, so tired of going through the ups and downs. I\\'ve never experienced life without PTSD (can\\'t say as much for the earlier years of life due to natural fogginess), and it\\'s like...why do I try? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAlso, I\\'ve been trying to treat myself but it\\'s hard to watch myself from the outside unless I start disassociating and that\\'s not a good state to do psychological archaeology.', 'Flair': 'Discussion'}, 'Post 5': {'Title': 'This article describes what its like to have PTSD', 'Text': '[**Trauma can change your brain**](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2015/09/16/the-science-behind-ptsd-symptoms-how-trauma-changes-the-brain/)\\xa0— and for those who go on to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this trauma can carry into your everyday life. It’s not something you can “just forget,” and someone’s triggers might not make sense to\\xa0people who’ve never experienced it. But PTSD is very real, offering daily challenges and making a world that once seems safe suddenly scary.\\n\\nTo find out what it’s really like to have PTSD, we asked [**people in our mental health community**](https://www.facebook.com/MentalHealthOnTheMighty/posts/1870602513208458) to describe what it’s like.\\n\\n**Here’s what they shared with us:**\\n\\n**1.** “It’s constantly looking over your shoulder and having difficulty trusting people… It’s not just something you can walk away from.” —\\xa0Kathryn P.\\n\\n**2.** “Triggers can come from anywhere at any time… a smell, a look/ glance, a vibe, a dream… how someone treats you. You are unable, as hard as you try, to turn it off.” —\\xa0Mike T.\\n\\n**3.** “The best description I’ve ever come across is the Walking Dead episode ‘Here’s Not Here.’ One character describes PTSD: ‘You saw it happen. That’s how this started, right? It’s all happening right in front of your eyes over and over. Your body’s here, but your mind is still there. There’s a door and you want to go through it to get away from it, so you do and it leads you right back to that moment. And you see that door again and you know it won’t work, but, hell, maybe it’ll work. So you step through that door and you’re right back in that horrible moment every time. You still feel it every time. So you just want to stop opening that door. So you just sit in it. But I assure you, one of those doors leads out, my friend.’” —\\xa0Tara H.\\n\\n**4.** “You know that feeling you get when someone jumps out and scares you and you are on high alert for a few minutes? That alertness never goes away for me.” —\\xa0Holly M.\\n\\n**5.** “It’s like you’re tidying your house before a dinner party. But there’s this one item that’s just out of place. The doorbell rings. It’s your guests. You just shove that item into the closet and tell yourself you’ll deal with it later. You start to do this every time. Filling the closest more and more. Saying to yourself that you’ll deal with it later. The closet becomes so full that it starts to creak. That’s your bodies way of saying ‘Hey! You got a lot of stuff to deal with! It’s time!’ But you keep thinking it’s fine. Out of sight, out of mind. You ignore the closet. Until one day it’s too much. The closet bursts. And everything comes flying out in weird and wacky ways. Panic attacks. Dissociative episodes. Depression. Anxiety. Flashbacks. Intrusive thoughts. And then you’re left lying on the floor with all the items that were stuffed into the closet, splattered around you. Forced to finally accept what happened. And forced to finally deal with it. Forced to clean up the items around you and find appropriate places for each thing. And then over time, slowly, you learn what to do with each item, and how to deal with each thing, uniquely.” —\\xa0Nargis D.\\n\\n**6.** “It’s like a side show ‘fun house;’ you never know what’s around the corner to screw up your day.

At times after just getting up I’m unable to differentiate whether I’m awake or asleep. They feel so real, I even experience the physical pain in them. Then while I am at home if someone knocks on my door I could scream and start rocking back and forth.” —\\xa0Will D.\\n\\n**8.** “It’s difficult to explain. Sometimes it’s the feeling that something bad is right behind you. Every car door that shuts at night is something bad. It’s being afraid to go to sleep because you know the nightmares are waiting. No one can be trusted. I constantly feel like someone is behind me. It’s being so hyper-vigilant every minute, it’s exhausting. Certain places or a flash of something brings it all crashing back down on you. It’s feeling like every day you’re going to die, and sometimes wishing for death just to get away from the memories.” —\\xa0Jennifer T.\\n\\n**9.** “You’re constantly on guard. You can never rest without thinking about something. I get panicked at the slightest thing that wouldn’t bother anyone like loud bangs or someone’s footsteps, or someone calling my name and I don’t know where it’s coming from.” —\\xa0Ross R.\\n\\n**10.** “It’s like being trapped in a time capsule. Your surroundings change, but you’re forever in the state of your trauma — flashes of memories through all five senses, body memories, nightmares — it consumes your entire being and never by choice!” —\\xa0Corey L.\\n\\n**11.** “Imagine walking down the yellow stripe in the middle of a crowded street: it’s happy and sunny and everyone is doing everything great — but if you lose your balance or get pushed to the left side, it’s dark and scary. Few people know the left side.” —\\xa0Brynn L.\\n\\n**12.** “PTSD\\xa0is a bunch of nightmares during the day. I lose grips on where I am, and I get lost in the memory.

It feels so real, and next thing I wake up and do not know how I got to where I am now.” —\\xa0Nicole V.\\n\\n**13.** “It’s like when you watch a scary movie and you’re on edge the entire time… except that’s how you live, all day, every day. You’re literally afraid of everything.” —\\xa0Kate M.\\n\\n**14.** “It’s like living in a slideshow instead of a video. Everything is choppy and confusing. There’s doubt, chaos and terror night and day.” —\\xa0Adele E.\\n\\n**15.** “I always compare it to the episode of ‘Spongebob’ when he was trying to remember his name and inside of his head people were looking through all the filing cabinets, but couldn’t find it so they started burning everything up and completely destroyed the memory bank… it’s like certain things trigger an episode whether it’s a smell or even a certain color. It causes me to panic.” —\\xa0Shonte R.\\n\\n**16.** “It’s like being hit by a car and you never see the car coming! It knocks you down, and when you try to get up another car hits you again.” —\\xa0Minister W.\\n\\n**17.** “It’s like a rubber band in that\\xa0you can stretch so far out of your comfort zone, but once you’ve been triggered you fly back right to where you started.” —\\xa0Rachel M.\\n\\n**18.** “It’s like being afraid of the monster under your bed that no one else really believes is there. It can creep up on u at any moment, and the smallest of things can trigger it.” —\\xa0Destiny B.\\n\\n**19.** “Having PTSD for me is like being set apart from everyone else, finding fault with everyone you meet and walking a constant tightrope between fight or flight.

I\\'ve had tiny moments of anxiety my whole life but I didn\\'t realize what it was at the time. One day in high school, I started feeling very off. It felt like my whole body was swaying, my hands were sweaty, I couldn\\'t sit still, I was pretty certain I was going to have a heart attack. \\n\\nAfter that class I went home and felt better, the next day I started getting that exact same feeling in the exact same class. That\\'s when it started to click for me what was going on. It was pretty quiet for a few weeks until one day after school, I drove to Dunkin to get a coffee. It was very busy and I had to wait a while. I started feeling off, I would sit, then stand, then sit, then stand. I was getting very uncomfortable and started getting that swaying feeling. This time though, I started to feel numbness, I didn\\'t know how to control my breathing. My face, hands, and feet went completely numb and I ran out of Dunkin and got in my car and drove home with no feeling in my body for several minutes. I remember I was drinking like a 3 day old coke cause thats the only thing I had in my car and my mouth was so dry\\n\\nSince then I\\'ve only had 1 other major panic attack where my fingers got so numb that they became ice cold and froze in place like i was making a claw. I\\'ve had tons and tons of anxiety attacks since then but everything has been managed. I was diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder in 2019. Still I went to college and started going to therapy. \\n\\nMy first semester just wasn\\'t good. I wasn\\'t in the right place of mind to be in college and that point. I couldn\\'t focus, I was unmotivated, I was anxious. I was actually accepted to this college before my anxiety to play soccer but I quit knowing it would be way too much. My first therapist while in college gave me a quick 5 minute exam then prescribed my adderall after I said I had trouble focusing. I was so upset that he just wanted to medicate me and not talk. I never went back to that guy. I ended up dropping out of college. I stopped living there a few weeks earlier and tried commuting but I just stopped going. I would go sit in a parking lot for hours so I could convince my parents I was going. \\n\\nI realized how messed up this was as my parents were paying for my college so I finally told them and they just knew I needed help and a break. Luckily for me, my mom also struggled with GAD bad as a teen and young adult. When she started realizing what was going on with me and saw how fast I was falling, she took me to her first husbands grave who passed away young have a heart condition. I didn\\'t understand it at the time, but she told me that no matter how bad life gets, it\\'s better to be here on earth. She knew that with anxiety comes depression and intrusive thoughts. This was a nice thing because at the time I did have uncontrollable thoughts. I kept thinking \"I\\'m going crazy\" \"I\\'m going to kill myself one day\". I never actively wanted to die, but my thoughts were telling me that. \\n\\nThat winter I ended up enrolling in a local college. For the first few weeks, I couldn\\'t sit in a classroom for the full time. I started talking to people, engaging more in my work, and I found some comfort. I was doing really well and then covid came. For most people, this was really bad, but for me, I thought being online and the lockdown was so helpful. I was getting college credits without having to leave my room and it was pretty easy for me. I also started doing therapy again online. Over covid is where I realized the major of my anxiety stems from being a hypochondriac. The symptoms that come with having GAD where making me think I had health issues. \\n\\nMy therapist specialized in deep breathing and mindfulness and it worked so well for me. After covid, I decided I wanted to get back out there, so i transferred to a school where my two best friends go and I was going to live with them. It was a big jump being a little over an hour from home but having my hometown friends was huge. I had my expected bumps and anxious moments my first semester. I ended up failing one class, but I held on and finished strong. My second semester I finished with a 3.5 which was huge for me. My last semester of high school, my anxiety caused me to have a 1.9. In college if I didn\\'t drop out it was usually around a 2.5. \\n\\nNow here we are today. It\\'s hard to explain how I\\'m feeling. Maybe the word is \"stuck\"? From the start of this semester, I never really felt like I settled in and got in a groove. Sleep, eat, school, repeat. I got complacent and stopped challenging myself. I was about to give a presentation about a month ago and I started to panic for no reason. Now I have 2 big presentations this week and the more I think about them the more I panic. I wake up and just feel dread and no motivation to do anything school. I definitely have a classic case of burnout but the stress and lack of motivation has caused my anxiety to come back. I can\\'t focus in classes, I have no motivation to try on my work, I\\'ve been skipping classes. I have come such a long way and don\\'t want to go backwards.\\n\\nI went from not being able to leave my house to being a full time college student an hour from home and do fairly decent. It seems like I just hit a hill and I\\'m slowly going back down. Any suggestions how to work through anxiety in the classroom and brain function?', 'Flair': 'Work/School'}, 'Post 2': {'Title': 'Should I be concerned or am I just in my head?', 'Text': 'Hey everyone, this is my first post to Reddit, so please go easy on me. I\\'ve been considering making this for a while but wasn\\'t sure which community to post to. \\n\\nI\\'m 24 (25 next month), I go to college during the day and work overnight, and I\\'ve always had pretty bad anxiety. I\\'ve been on a few different medications (Lexapro, Paxil, and Effexor), but this month will make a year since being on Effexor. I was able to come off said medication primarily because at the time I\\'d saved up enough money to take nearly a year break from working to focus on myself and school. However, since returning to work in May (fast food), I\\'ve slowly felt my anxiety creeping back in. Some of these anxious beliefs were founded in reality; mainly, I faced some discrimination and harassment at my first job location, so I transferred to a new location across town, had a similar issue, decided to quite the job completely, and start something outside of fast food. I now work as an overnight stocker at a retail store, and while the pressure of dealing with customers is now nonexistent, the employees still feel like an obstacle. \\n\\nTo be specific, this past week, I was assigned to work an area alone I\\'d never worked before (today will make a month there, so I\\'m still pretty new). In this type of situation, I generally am not anxious because I trust my work ethic enough to know that while I\\'m still new and unfamiliar, I can work quickly and accurately enough to be up for the challenge. However, around 3am when I return from lunch, I\\'m starting my second to last pallet when another regular employee (she\\'s close with both the overnight coach and a team lead) comes to deliver a message. She starts by asking me how much I have left, and I respond by telling her that I have one more pallet after this one. She then says, \"Okay,\\' waits a beat, and then says, \"He needs you need to be done.\" I assume by \"he\" that she\\'s referring to the coach but am confused by how vague she\\'s being and why she\\'s telling me this. I wanted to press further, but I don\\'t like to show my anxiousness, so I remain casual and say, \"Done? Like right now?\" She says, \"By 7, when your shift ends, you need to be cleaned up and finished with these pallets.\" I\\'m confused again because there would be no reason to tell me this unless I normally am not finished by 7, but there\\'s only been one night in the past month that I\\'ve not been finished by 7. At this point, I couldn\\'t hide how confused and anxious I was by this ambiguity of this situation. So I hesitantly respond by saying, \"Okay. . . \" She then says, \"He\\'s testing you,\" again referring to the overnight coach. I say, \"A test? What does that mean?\" She responds, \"It\\'s a good test,\" and then seemingly in attempt to reassure me goes on to explain that the employee normally in my area generally takes all night to stock the area even with another employee helping, and the overnight coach wants to prove a point that one employee can do it alone. Based on the tone of the conversation and what she\\'d said before, I have a hard time believing this but accept her explanation and move on with finishing the pallets. This wouldn\\'t be the first time I\\'ve felt such ambiguity at this workplace regarding me, but this was definitely the most explicit manifestation of it. \\n\\nI finished the pallets by 6, had enough time to clean up, and while I\\'m in the backroom dropping off a few things, I pass the employee who\\'d spoken to me earlier who says, \"Great job today, you did so well. Make sure they tell you that you did well,\" and despite her tone of voice being rather neutral, her facial expression looks oddly happy or elated. I thank her and for a moment continue what I was doing, but I couldn\\'t help but politely confront her about the situation earlier. I approach her and say, \"Was that really about the other associate being slow or was it about me?\" She says, \"No, you did great, I\\'ve only heard good things about you.\" I say, \"Are you sure?\" She repeats, \"Yes, only good things.\" I end the conversation, finish what I was doing, and return to zone my area. \\n\\nThere were plenty of other things that occurred in that night, but I can\\'t be sure if they were just me being anxious or if they were real. However, I can\\'t help but be incredibly nervous and apprehensive about this environment now and how these employees feel about me. I\\'m also confused because I know a few other new employees who objectively have worse work ethics (showing up to work late, clocking out early, putting things on overstock when they could go on the shelves, not working efficiently) but from what I\\'m aware of, these employees aren\\'t spoken to in this vague manner and aren\\'t given the same workload. I\\'ve even asked the team leads here and there about my performance, and they always say that I\\'m doing fine. Am I just in my head? I have an appointment January 3rd with my general practitioner, and I certainly don\\'t want to get back on my medicine if I\\'m not just being anxious, but if I am, this is reason enough to do so. Please let me know your thoughts, I really would like many outside, honest opinions.\\n\\n If for some reason this isn\\'t the right community, I\\'d appreciate referrals to other places.', 'Flair': 'Work/School'}, 'Post 3': {'Title': 'Can anyone help?', 'Text': \"I recently quit a job where management was shit and everyone was pretty much over worked. I did my externship there, so I always knew that as soon as I got enough experience, I’d be out of there in a heartbeat. There was this female older supervisor who just a total dick.. Everyone around her would have to guess what mood she was in every single day before even speaking to her. Always catch her talking about shopping or her ex-husband more than actual work. She Would ignore anybody who didn’t kiss her ass enough just because she’s been there for like 20yrs Anyway, you guys get the picture before leaving that job I had an exit interview? First time that's ever happened, so didn’t know what to expect. HR started asking questions like where could they improve or if I got any comments, I’d like to share about the company. At first, I couldn’t think of anything, so I just said good things to get it over with, but Then I thought of that supervisor and said that I wished she’d be easier to talk to sometimes because it seemed that at times I was unable to communicate with her. Nothing drastic just in simple nice words what I could think of on the spot. HR thank me for opening up, and I left the room. When I went back to the office, two of my coworkers (the ones I was the closest with) asked me what happened. After telling them, they were thrilled that I told HR about our supervisor! And were also reminding me of all the crap the supervisor has done to them in specific. I couldn’t remember all that, so I said man “I missed some things I could’ve said” and one of my coworkers told me that I should go back and tell the girl from HR since she was still in the conference room, so my dumb ass actually did.. In my head, I thought I was doing one good last deed? And fuck I thought these girls were going to keep being my friends even after I left, so I wanted to do something good? we have a group chat together, and before leaving they told me they’d let me know what happened with everything(I know I shouldn’t care by then, but they knew how much of freak I am that I tend to need reassurance with everything or ales my anxiety kicks in) a week passed, and I didn’t hear from them again. This whole situation was and has been eating me since I don’t like the feeling of not knowing. It sucks so much because I opened up to these girls about my anxious behavior and how I constantly need reassurance that everything is ok. I have a great job now with new opportunities and a crazy pay increase from when I was working in that shit whole I should be jumping on one leg of how happy I should be, yet I’m still worried, missing sleep and all because my mind is full of scenarios of what has happened since I’ve been gone and what everyone is thinking about me? I know all I said was true and also far fetch to wish for something to happen since the supervisor has been there for decades but my need for reassurance is crazy... I decided to message the gc with with a “happy Monday” and one of them replied  hrs later asking me how I’m doing, after some small talk I asked her if anything had happened after I left with the supervisor, and she said that “apparently” I had complained about her behavior, and they were going to talk to her about it but that everyone ales said that wasn’t the case, so nothing ended up happening. I was speechless.. what does she mean by APPARENTLY??? She’s the one who literally convinced me to go back and rant some more, she knows exactly what happened and now everyone doesn’t know what I was thinking? She was acting as if she didn’t know what I said, yet she knew exactly what happened because I literally told them!. I know this shouldn’t bother me and this is an old job, but now I feel like a bigger idiot. I keep thinking I shouldn’t have done anything! Why are people like this? Why do they have to be two faced?

My mental health had been declining for a while due to me living alone and feeling lonely, and having \"nothing to do\": I had already finished my classes last year and all I had to do was lab work. One of the biggest issues I have is anxiety over talking to my professor, especially sending emails or messages. So I never communicated my struggles with her.\\n\\nI finished my lab activities in November, and sent the data for my professor to analyze, since the software is only installed in her home computer. She only got the results back to me a week before Christmas.

What happened today was a cascade of one anxiety after another.\\n\\nBy way of background, I quit my last job because of anxiety issues dealing with co-workers and decided to go back to school for a masters degree (data science.)  I'm almost done the degree and decided to try and get an internship.  I was able to get a Zoom interview scheduled today with a major company.\\n\\nSo here is the cascade of anxiety-producing horrors that befell me today:\\n\\n1.) I print out a copy of my resume to have during the interview when questioned.  I panic as I look at the long stretches of unemployment and struggle to come up with good explanations.  In my mind, I believe that no one will ever hire again for any good job.\\n\\n2.)  I print out the LinkedIn bio's of the people interviewing me today.  They both have PhD's from prestigious schools and have serious research accomplishments.  I already have severe imposter syndrome and I feel so inferior and dumb.  I panic I will expose my lack of intelligence.\\n\\n3.)  I start setting up my laptop for the interview.  I can't find a clean professional camera angle in my bedroom so I frantically have to tear the room apart so I can just sit in front of a blank wall (moving major pieces of furniture.)  I then get a look at myself through the Zoom camera.  I'm horrified how I look.  I hate the way my face looks - especially my nose.  I get embarrassed at how I look and think the interviewers will mock me internally.  I then look at my skin and hair.  I can't believe how old I look - age lines and graying temples.  I think I'm probably too old now to ever get hired again. (early 40s.)  So, I decide I need a crappier camera.  I get an older laptop with a less resolute camera.  Now, I need to find an acceptable angle.  I pile almost every book I have on a table to get the right height.  Then I find the angle isn't flattering, so I have to put folded up pieces of paper to under the back of the laptop to shift the angle downward.  I finally get a good angle, but now I'm worried the whole tower will collapse in the middle of the interview.  Then I fiddle with the lighting. I contort these various USB lights to get a satisfactory lighting that doesn't make me look too old.\\n\\n4.)  Next I test the audio.  The laptop audio sounds like crap, so I decide try my airpods mic.  That sounds like crap too.  Finally, I resort to a full headset with a mic.  The audio tests sounds great, but now I look like a dork.  I'm anxious they won't think I look professional.\\n\\n5.)  I decide to wear a jacket and tie and realize I forgot how to tie a tie.  I have to scramble for videos on the easiest tie tying techniques.  I finally get it tied.\\n\\n6.)  I'm finally 10 minutes from the interview and I realize I can't find my suit jacket.  I throw everything around my room looking for said jacket and don't find it.  I frantically run through the house looking for it.  I finally find it hanging on the back of the bathroom door ( I took it off when I was attempting to tie my tie.)  I get back to laptop 2 minutes before the interview started.\\n\\n7.)  I enter the Zoom room and no one else is there at the appointed time.  I wait five minutes and then wonder if I did something wrong.  Did I accept the wrong Zoom invite?  Did the interviewers wait a few minutes and then give up?  Well, finally the interviewers arrive about 10 minutes late and apologize for their lateness and commence the interview.\\n\\nI mean, the interviewers were very nice and respectful and really didn't hammer me much about my periods of unemployment.  There was a personality set of questions that I think I did OK with.  I stammered a bit at first, but then got more comfortable as things went on.  The technical question portion wasn't hard per se in that there was no question I couldn't answer.  I think they were wanted to see the richness and detail of your answer.   After the interview ended, I thought of a lot more I wish I included.\\n\\nAnyway, I have no idea if I'll get the internship, but I thought it might be worth sharing what living with anxiety can be like.\", 'Flair': 'Work/School'}}, 'relationships': {'Post 1': {'Title': 'Help', 'Text': '  I am M (23) and she uw/bpd F (26) was my first love. I was a virgin and had never had a girlfriend, despite everyone saying im good looking, I was always shy. 7 months ago I met the most beautiful girl ive ever seen on a dating app who had just moved to my city from Hong Kong 3 weeks prior with her family (9/10 in looks is fair). Immediately on our first date the vibing fireworks were crazy, we matched on so many things, discussed so much, it was like a dream, we connected on Philosophy, music, shared values, we danced into the night and we got extremely intimate very fast. \\n\\nI should have seen the warning signs. After dropping her back home, I received 2 calls and 15 messages in the morning about how she was terrified and that she shouldnt have been intimate with me as she doesnt usually do that outside a relationship, and while I was in the gym and the library studying, she accused me of seeing other girls at 11am in the morning. These were all insane red flags, but as I thought she was beautiful and we vibed so much, I assumed it was just a culture difference or something, so I reassured and we went in a second date. The fireworks continue, yet so did the arguments, 2 weeks in we had met 3 times and argued 3 times over text mainly. It was always culture differences so I didnt think much of it. She said shes extremely sensitive but I liked that because it made her deep thinking and from what ive read on here unlike most shes extremely empathetic, I mean genuinely she will feel the pain of others intensely. \\n\\nShe pressured me 3.5 weeks in saying that she couldnt see me unless we were in a relationship and that she needed that reassurance and asked whether I care about her. For me this was too soon, and again another red flag, but I thought again a culture difference, as asian culture is more conservative in regards to initmacy, and that is partly why, but now ive realised it was mainly because of her emotional insecurities that even 3 weeks into knowing someone she was emotionally unstable if that guy couldnt provide guarantees. \\n\\nMore red flags to come.\\n\\nBut also not just red flags, I would like to say unlike many, she is the sweetest girl I have ever met, she has never been intentionally abusive, she is always thinking about others, always buying gifts to my family and making an effort even tho she struggles socialising, seeing my friends, writing me love letters expressing her feelings and how ive pushed her through a depressing phase of immigration and having no jobs and no friends at this time in her life.\\n\\n1 month in she felt insecure and said she needed to know that I loved her. At that time I didnt, but a week later her pressure maybe catalysed it, but it genuinely came when I started to think about love more. Finally after 1.5 months I told her I love her, I wrote her a poem, she cried.\\n\\nRed flag - She told me that if I hadnt asked her this week she would have blocked me and not talked to me again, she said after 2 weeks she might contact me again but she couldnt handle that insecurity of not knowing as she loved me so much and i didnt love her, I checked her texts and she had told her old friend (she had not friends that ever lasted) that she would block me if I didnt say I love her as she felt insecure and thought I could still be a fuckboy (I told her im a virgin and emotionally soft).\\n\\nRed flag - She told me she has had 13 past relationships spanning multiple up to 3 years, but some just a month and they all ended because although some of the guys were toxic and some were nice, they all said they couldnt handle her emotions. I thought those guys are horrible, I can save her be there for her. This personality flaw of always wanting to help combined with love blinded me to the bigger picture. That although some of these guys were toxic, at least half, she even admitted left her because of her intense feelings, but I thought she seems so sweet, how dare they do that to her, I didnt see what she really meant. \\n\\nAs time went on she became more loving, baking me stuff, spending her small wage on me, writing love letters, we vibed talked about life, had great experience together, she spent days painting me pictures dedicated to us, which were incredible.\\n\\nBut over time it was getting me down. I spent hours and hours looking for jobs for her as it made her depressed and I was taking on that depression and those insecurities. She would cry a lot, sometimes talking about how everyone left and she didnt want me to abandon her, I thought shes so sweet and made so many promises to her. She said she was nothing, and that I gave her something. Everytime we would call at night she would talk about her day for 30 mins and then when I get excited to talk about my day she says shes too tired and needs to sleep, which was fair as she worked early in a warehouse, but then why call if its always on sided? I understood as I come from a financially privileged background and she doesnt, but over time I felt emotionally rejected. There were many times where she listened to emotions and helped me be more in touch with them, but it was always mixed. The second I question this and say I feel emotionally rejected she plays victim and talks about how hard it is for in a toxic family household, with a warehouse job and no friends, I understood and always apologised, but this always ground me down and made me feel like I was walking on eggshells, I just didnt realise at the time.\\n\\nThen came the bigger arguments, twice she created an argument out of something tiny and shouted at me and stormed away in public, disappearing. For example the first argument she stormed away because I didnt take good pictures of her and she made an effort to look good and I couldnt capture that. I went after her and comforted her. The second time it was another small thing. I comforted and went after her. I never raised me voice, I always stayed calm. Deep down I knew this was a huge issue and red flag, how could I be with someone who communicated and acted like this over small issues.\\n\\nThe third time it happened, I felt empty, numb, I felt rejected, abandoned and I didnt have the energy to go after her, I thought this isnt my fault, if she loves me she will come back to me, and she did. She apologised and she brightened up and was also happy and bought me a meal, it was like an emotional release for her, but those emotions were released onto me. I talked to her about it and said its not fair, if we are equal and then I shouldnt be running after you everytime. She thought about it and introspected and said that she agrees because she loves me and believes in equality and doesnt want me to feel rejected and that she does it because she wants to feel comfort and attention from me and know I care. I said that doesnt make sense as you know how much I care about you and love you. I always comfort you, I drive you everywhere, I paid for your stuff when you cant afford it, I spend hours everyday applying for jobs on behalf of you, I introduce to my social circle and even grandparents, I write letters, I support you emotionally and in every way and its still not enough. She said shes knows but in that moment its not logical she just needs to feel it. And she said she knows its wrong and she wont do it again.\\n\\nRed flag - She tells me that in her past she was so much worse, she smashed up apartment, tried to commit suicide and ended up in a mental hospital, cried in public and begged people to stay screaming, hurt herself. She said that shes improved so much now (which based on the past is 100% true) and that all she does is walk away from me because she needs space and feels depressed because of her situation and is too tired to hear about my day. I know shes right, that improvement is insane. I think she had major BPD in the past which apparently led her to have epilepsy seizures and religious experiences and blackouts (but she doesnt know its bpd even tho im sure it is) and now shes improved so much and so it hurts her when I make a big deal and ask her to try and change her emotions. She says I cant see the change but she tries everyday.\\n\\nNow onto the straw the broke the camels back. I felt normal, we are 6 months into a relationship, I pick her up and she told me she had a cold and my response was \"Oh you should have told me and we could have gone for a walk another day\". She was surprised and hurt and said that she was looking forward to seeing more all week and now I dont want her. We go to walk and she refuses to get out the car, I say I dont have the emotional energy for this. For me its such a little thing, I was so excited to see her as well, and I was just half joking while driving saying that I should have seen her another as im gonna get sick now, I even laughed and smiled at her cheekily as I said it. She finally gets out the car, and I feel so tired because I know this will be a repeat cycle and I cant deal with the emotional stress anymore, the stepping on eggshells, the overreactions and emotionally charged arguments. We begin walking and she says how it makes her feel, I say I understand but you cant let such small thing affect you, my mums parents are almost dying, shes struggling and I have to support her, in this situation all I said was I dont wanna get sicka and the reaction is like I just cheated on you, she says it doesnt matter, whats important is not how big the perceived issue but the way it makes someone feel, again I said I understand but you cant communicate like that throughout life and it turned into her shouting and she walked away. I felt numb, empty. I think I knew in my heart there and then that it was over, not because I couldnt love her or forgive her. But because my emotions were beyond repair. I had anxiety after 20 mins and I ran after her calling for her, these are busy roads at high speeds and she doesnt know she is, im shaking. I finally find her and we talk it out, but I just feel numb. \\n\\nThat was 9 days ago, ever since then I know longer think of her in the same way. Even though 90% of the time shes so sweet and caring, the 10% overwhelmed me so much that thinking of her and being round her started to give me anxiety and I felt a knot in my stomach. I was with her and she was being intimate but she felt like a stranger to me. Like it didnt feel natural to hold her hand, she didnt make me happy anymore just feeling weird and anxious, like the first 2 dates when I didnt really know her. \\n\\nSo I told her I needed space and time to process my emotions and that this argument and more so the repeated overeactions have overwhelmed. At first she didnt understand and text me saying that she would block me and I ruined her life by pushing her away and leaving and abandoning her. 10 Minutes later even though I need my space, I text her and say do you want to call, and she says I feel fine now, just doing some work. The quick emotional flips are insane which is what makes me thinking its BPD.\\n\\nShe can be an angel and flip just like that.\\n\\nAfter 3 days we met up and I recieved something so unexpected it broke me into tears. She apologised, she said she was wrong for walking away and making me feel abandoned and hurting me. She said she wants to change and that I have helped through so much (At this time she finally found a job and I had celebrated and cried with her 1 week prior) and that walking away is wrong and she didnt realise it made feel so deep and hurt and that I was that sensitive. \\n\\nShe said that she realises she doesnt know how to love and she doesnt know why and that all this time shes done so many things for me that shes never done before, that shes always received love but never known how to give it. She said shes never baked before, but she learnt just so she could see a smile on me and my familys face when she brings cookies to my house. She said shes never payed for guys meals, she goes out of her way to spend £5 on a box of sushi when she has £50 in her bank account, just so she can see the smile on my face. She said she knows that she doesnt know how to her love and communicate and regulate her emotions, but shes trying and she wants to try and communicate and support me in the ways I have done to her because she truly loves me.\\n\\nAfter this day I felt back to normal again, and she actually seemed changed, when she would call she would ask all about my day and my feelings, I had an interview and she said how much she supports me and how much I deserve it and that if I keep pushing then one day I will achieve it and that she will always have my back no matter what. She started asking about my emotions when we felt likr a disgareement was coming up and it was working. But then 2 days later, the feeling came back and I couldnt control it, like she was a stranger and I was anxious and didnt feel myself around her. I think i realised no matter what she says and makes positive change, I have been emotionally overwhelmed numbed and unitnetionally on her part damaged so much that I dont think I can recover. \\n\\nI genuienly think that she is trying and is changing, but its only been a week, but I cant change my feeling of fear, slight resentment and distance. The damage is done, and I dont want that damage but I cant control that regradless of whether she changes or not.\\n\\nI met her last night after a few days space and planned to go in telling her that I know she needs comfort, love and constant reassurance, but I cant provide her that even though Im still willing to be with her and love her and support her, and she has to accept that the old loving me has been pushed away by her actions, but im willing to make an effort to try and work through it, if shes willing to accept the love isnt the same anymore. \\n\\nThis led to a full mental breakdown. It was the most terrifying, heart breaking and traumatising thing I have ever seen. She started hitting herself, wailing, saying im leaving her and im like all the others, that she will be lonely again and shes not sure if she can live anymore with this crippling lonliness. She started talking about all the expectations she had, and started crying when thinking about the fact we will never have the baby we dreamed about or the apartment or the life that she craved and hoped for and that she really put every expectation on this, even introducing me to her parents within 2 months, despite her never doing it until at least a year as she finally saw me as the one. She literally fell down to my feet and begged for me not to leave her. It traumatised me but I just kept telling her its okay, your okay, breathe, youre safe and strong, please breathe for me, im always going to be here for you no matter what happens. I then held her down as she started punching her face and helped her breathe with me. \\n\\nThe one thing that scarred me is that she kept saying stuff in between. She said you are so kind, you couldnt have known this is the real me, its not your fault, im just a terrible person, im stupid and i hate myself, I shouldnt exist, I dissapoint everybody, my parents, every bf ive ever had has left me, some even cut themselves over me. Its a cycle and I cant escape, im only human. I said I want you to get some help because I care about you and her reaction was are you saying im crazy, im mentally ill, im insane is this the way youve always looked at me, i dont need help I tried already, I cant be helped, this is me.\\n\\nI couldnt break up with her. I was so emotionally traumatized. I couldnt bring myself to break a broken woman. I couldn\\'t break the woman that 95% of the time, I love so intensely for her character, actions, values and personality but the 5% is mentally breaking me.\\n\\nSo I dropped her back, went home and woke my parents up at 3am and broke down. I havent slept or eaten.\\n\\nI dont know what to do. She has no one in her life, no friends, her family dont speak to her, shes in a foreign country and she refused help. I want to help her but she has to help herself. I cant deal with this.

Because my birthday is at the end of the school year I was the youngest in my year group. My first two years were absolute hell. My whole year group bullied me because I was the weird kid. I was already mentally fucked but those two years really screwed me up.\\n\\nIn my third year my brother started highschool so I had someone I could actually talk to which helped a little. I was still bullied but I had somewhere to go instead of hiding in the toilets in the technology department that no one used.\\n\\nMy bus stop changed that year and happened to be the same as my brothers (different dad\\'s) at that bus stop there was a seriously cute blond kid that talked to me straight away without instantly judging me. She became riends with my brother so when we met up after school she was also with us.\\n\\nWe became friends that only saw eachother meeting up with the others. We got closer. We started meeting up before we met the others. She treated me so well compared to anyone else.\\nI made the mistake of telling someone I had a crush on her, her reaction was to kick me in the balls so hard I was sick, she was seriously good at football.\\n\\nA year later she was 13 I was 14. We started hanging out by ourselves. We never really said it but from the outside people either thought we were dating but most just knew we were besties.\\nI remember the first time I was invited into her house, I was so nervous and shy but her parents were lovely.\\n\\nHer d ad started taking me to football matches, he\\'d pick me up so it was just me and him. He was hilarious typical funny dad type of guy. We\\'d meet her at the stadium because she played her female football matches near by. One day he introduced me to his friend as his future son in law, obviously I wanted the earth to swallow me.\\n\\nMy relationship with my single parent father was absolutely terrible in this part of my life, he was an alcoholic (still is but we have a great relationship now) I got blamed for everything. We\\'d argue until I had a mental breakdown. I spent more time at hers than I did at my own house.\\n\\nWe\\'d sit in her room talking and listening to music. Some of the most comforting parts of my life. She didn\\'t have any interest in dating me but she accepted that she was friends with a guy, me, that was borderline in love with her. She started flirting with guys online, some were blatantly in their 20\\'s talking to a 13, 14 year old girl.\\n\\nInstead of worrying about her I got jealous and angry, then depressed and spiteful.

She was 14 and started dating a 20 year old guy Damian. I was told by a girl who was in my year that this 20 year old prick pushed her to have sex with him when she was also 14 when he was 18. I was seriously worried for my friend.\\n\\nShe wouldn\\'t go see Damian without me also being there. I watched my 14 year old bestie have her first kiss with a 20!year old who gave me serious pedo vibes. I told her he just wanted her virgity, she said he was better than that.

Felt like a punch in the stomach when they kissed\\n\\nOne day I was at home and got a call from my bestie, \\'you were right about him\" is all she said at the start.

They split up.\\n\\nI started college at 16, college was weird as fuck. No one was bullying me anymore. I made friends easily. I met a girl in a pagan shop, we stayed in the shop talking for 2 hours the shopkeeper kept checking on us, she knew we were flirting. A week later I had a beautiful goth girlfriend, I was an anxious paranoid mess of an undiagnosed person so we split up after two weeks. I was sad so my college friend gave me a bottle of vodka and said DRINK IT QUICK THERES A POLICEMAN COMING.\\n\\nthere was no policeman but I was now blackout drunk. Apparently I kept hugging my college friend, made out with a random girl and told her I loved her, apparently we were talking for a couple of hours. The next day at college this girl was allover me, I didn\\'t know what to do. Ended up being pressured into a relationship I didn\\'t want. I was pressured into losing my virginity to her. At the same time I was drinking with another girl a couple of times a week. People finally liked me.\\n\\nMy mum gave me my first joint and then a joint with crack sprinkled in it. I realized that drugs made me feel good. Life felt fantastic even though in reality it was a fucking mess. I hung around with all these bad influences and barely had time for my bestie.\\n\\nWhile I was at College she dated no one, stayed single. I would tell her I\\'m getting the bus back and I\\'ll see her. I would be too busy fucking my life up and would get a later bus back. She would sit at the bus stop for hours waiting for me. What I realized years later was she had started getting feelings for me but hated drugs and alcohol, she was watching me fuck myself up. She realised I had stopped giving a shit so she walked away. \\n\\nAfter attempting college 3 times I dropped out, fortunately college is free in the UK. I started my first full time job. 3 months later they sacked me for being too inexperienced, told me to get experience elsewhere then come back.... Wankers\\n\\nI hit absolute rock bottom. Got some alcohol with the plan to unexist. I messaged me ex bestie, I needed a.dvice and she was the most level headed person I could think of.... She replied, told me to get up the next day and call as many bars, pubs and restaurants as I can find in the phone book\\n\\nI had an interview the next day at a pub 5 miles from my house, I was fit and healthy-ish back then so was cycling distance. The interview wemt perfectly, I started the job that evening. I was sneakily texting my bestie because she was suddenly putting \\'xx\\' at the end of messages and it gave me butterflies, I felt 13 again. We made plans to meet up at mine with some friends and get drunk.\\n\\nWe had our mini house party and things were going brilliantly, I was excited to have her back in my life. My dad came back kicked everyone out. So I walked her home, both being drunk. Outside her house we cuddled... That led to a kiss which was perfect, awkward smiles and goodbyes.

I got a Facebook message saying.... \"So I\\'m a slut\"\\nWe didn\\'t talk again after that.\\n\\nYears later I realized that phone call was to make me jealous like I did to her when I was at college. \\nIt\\'s a shame you only realise these things years later.

She denies being bipolar as her original diagnosis was when she was 15 and the doctor put her on depakote. She was having issues due to being abused by a neighbor is why she was admitted to see said doctor. Our marriage hasn\\'t been a storybook, but our friends and family looked at our marriage as near perfect as we had each other\\'s backs during all the ups and downs. Then 2-3yrs ago she got a new doctor and counselor, she had been sending photos to another man thru Snapchat around that time and I found out, psych put her on a few mood stabilizers and she told me they helped at the time. She got a hysterectomy and told a friend she was losing attraction to me since a few months after the surgery, she said she wanted to sleep with a female friend of hers and I relented, then she needed to be in a relationship with a woman and I relented, then she needed to be married to a woman and I broke into more pieces than the last 2 requests/demands caused. She can\\'t live in the same house as me as I was controlling and I will admit I had been at times when she was out partying or sleeping with other women until 3 or 6a the next morning while I was home with our daughters, usually around 16 times a month for the 3 months she was more active. I gave her a time to be home by midnight so I wouldn\\'t be alone at night. Part of the reconciliation of the Snapchat incident was to not have Snapchat and she kept asking for it back until I relented and she felt that was controlling I am guessing. She left two months ago without telling our girls and it\\'s been waves of emotion, today it\\'s bad for me as we had a fight last night. She had been coming over almost daily before and after work to see our daughters and called off from seeing them as she was tired or sick or busy, now she wants to cut down to only coming over 2 weekdays in the morning and after if she has openings. This let\\'s her see our daughters for maybe 20hrs a week. I noticed her phone background was of her gf and not our daughters anymore which put me off. We do have a psychiatrist appointment in December as her current has stopped answering calls and has changed her medications prior to her need to be with another woman to be entirely composed of SSRIs and SNRIs which I do feel has had a negative effect. His newest cocktail before my wife left also involved 2 drugs that induce comas when combined is also why I dislike the guy. During our fight we brought up old wounds of me being unemployed for nearing 18 months saying I never tried to find a new job, I probably could have settled for a entry job by not submitting my resume but I didn\\'t want to lie to people. I ended up getting a position with one of the companies that developed the COVID vaccine as a scientist for a time, I\\'m being vague due to legal reasons. Near the beginning of the pandemic (I worked for that company up til April 2020) I went out with a few guys and one of them ended up drugging me and I don\\'t know if I was SA or not due to me waking up during and crawling away. Myself and our friends had noted that my wife had not shown much support to me even though she is a SA survivor herself. We have had the financial difficulties which are now getting under control as I had to take over on them when she moved out. I feel exhausted being a solo dad and I hate that my 6yo has asked me if it\\'s hard being alone and why mommy had to leave sort of questions. I know I wasn\\'t a saint as my normal schedule was to work, come home, do a chore or two, go relax and play a game until girls needed to be picked up, then got them and made dinner, my wife would get home, we ate, then I would more often than not go back upstairs leaving my wife with the girls watching a movie/show, then bedtime routine of getting girls to bed, ending with wife on bed or couch and we would watch a show together until bed. Since the Snapchat incident began she has become engrossed in her phone and is on it constantly everywhere, and another controlling thing was me asking her to put her phone down constantly. We did have a fight over her gf meeting the girls after 2 weeks of them being together and then when she wanted to take our girls to an outing with her gf. I was toxic at that when I voiced I was not okay with the outing including her gf and her response was I can\\'t legally do anything about it and I said she couldn\\'t legally stop me from buying tickets and coming along either. We made a compromise of her watching our girls for a day so I could get away for awhile and I wouldn\\'t insert myself into her outing with her gf and our daughters. She lives with her gf and her wife who rents her a room for $200, I know money is tight for her as I paid for her gas a couple of times as had her father just so she could get to work and back. Her gf and her gf\\'s wife have blocked me after I asked \"why did you offer a room to my wife?\" She never responded and since then I was blocked from her fully. Wife says she doesn\\'t want to get involved in our marriage is why she blocked me. My MIL who is also BP invited my wife gf to Thanksgiving instead of me, my wife said she knew I probably wouldn\\'t be okay with it and declined it to where my MIL said \"f what OP thinks or wants.\" I don\\'t know why I keep trying to get through to her with the same statements, all it does is make her mad that \"all these people think they know me, better than myself\" and she says she hasn\\'t been disassociated since moving out as opposed to doing so since she was child before. She says she has never opened up to me fully and not told me everything in our marriage. I don\\'t fully believe that as she has confided a lot in me and I have love letters she has written me over the years telling me the opposite. \\n\\nThis was meant to be an advice post, but it turned into a rant after I started writing. I am looking for advice possibly, maybe statements of I am doing the right thing in trying to get her help and only giving up if she refuses help.

Need that dopamine. \\n\\nI asked for other types of sex, she would say she didn’t have the stamina. I said it would mean the world to me if you just tried. She never did. It hurts so much. \\n\\nShe would text her sexually manipulative ex when we were watching TV. She still wanted his approval. Wanted his approval when we weren’t having sex. It hurt. \\n\\nShe would talk about previous sexual experiences with other men with a huge smile on her face and we weren’t having sex. It hurt. \\n\\nI grew irritable. No sex for me as I swing back and forth in this emotional suicide swing. I feel so undesired. Why doesn’t she want me?\\n\\nHoneymoon to Jamaica? 7 nights? No sex. But she’s so kind and sweet. She’s so understanding of my irritability. I think. \\n\\nI have severe dissociation issues. I don’t know if I am losing months at a time or if my memories are even real. \\n\\n3.5 years in I am diagnosed with celiac. Afraid she’ll leave me. She says that’s it? That’s easy. She does all the shopping (we go together sometimes, but she’s there for 95% of the shopping) and all the cooking and most of the cleaning. I am disabled due to back hip and knee injury. I get many surgeries over the years. \\n\\nI was tortured in a kitchen most of my childhood. Burns on my hands. I am working on getting over it. I guess it wasn’t enough. She fantasizes about her abusive ex and how much he loved cooking. Compares him to me. It hurts. \\n\\nShe’s doing so many nice things for me. I’d trade half of them or more for some normal sex frequency. \\n\\nApparently I complained about the sex on 3 occasions that I don’t remember.  Nothing got better. \\n\\nShe gets her PhD. We move to a new city. She’s at job 8 months. No sex still. \\n\\nConfront her. Calmly but firmly. Finally expose how much pain I’m in. I know in my heart things will change. She loves me. She will save me from this suicidal pain of feeling unwanted cause of sex. Nothing changes. \\n\\nWe begin to fight. Hard. I start putting holes in walls. I don’t remember why. I don’t remember why we fight. I don’t remember why we yelled. She starts putting holes in walls. \\n\\nFight for almost 2 years. She started to have sex with me, but mostly out of obligation. It was a checkbox. I still didn’t feel desired.\\n\\nShe timidly asks ”would you like a blowjob?” I erupt in anger. I’m not sure why. Takes 2 years to realize it’s due to lack of a emotional connection. I can barely even get erect it feels so impersonal. \\n\\n2 years after fighting started we start having sex every day. Crazy awesome sex. We still fight. She becomes suicidal. I take knives out of her hand. I hear her load a gun from the other room. I have to take it from her hand. I have to unwrap cords from her neck. \\n\\nThe only reason she is suicidal is me. She thinks it’s the only escape. Did I do this? She sees me put a gun to my head twice. \\n\\nAlmost divorce. Get back together. 2 months go by, we start fighting again. Don’t feel desired. Still feels checkbox like. Did I ruin this? Was this all in my head?\\n\\nBig fight. She kicks me. Hard. She says it’s self defense. She says she was having a flashback of her father lunging at her mom. I believe her. She leans in to mindfulness. It goes good. She still yells at me sometimes when I am triggered and trying to regulate. Most connected I’ve ever felt in my entire life. Sex is crazy good too. \\n\\nI’m still irritable I think. Cat kicks me and scratches me when doorbell rings. I need to regulate. She naps with me. She is unhappy with my mood swings. She begins yelling and screaming and talking about how she should kill herself. I respond to threats of her hurting herself with threats of me hurting my self. I don’t know why. She sees me put a gun in my mouth. \\n\\nShe begins complimenting me like crazy during a lengthy sex session. I fall in to a dissociative state that accuses her of things she’s done in the marriage. Somehow I am 100% accurate. It hurts her. 10 days later I have a disinterest in sex and it hurts her feelings. She throws her shoes and has to go meditate. \\n\\nI feel fine for the almost 2 hours of time that passes. Then I dissociated and lost it. I yelled at her unprovoked for no reason. I kept yelling at her to fix this. I’m not sure what I meant. Maybe I wanted an apology? She no longer felt safe. I have no idea what she thinks of me. \\n\\nI know her intention was good. I know my intention was good. I’m losing my spouse and best friend. I wish I could of been better or stronger. She told me I’m not a real man this year. I never insulted her like that. It hurt to the core. I was able to easily forgive the six years of sexual frustration and neglect. Those words cut me to my core. After she said that for about a month I could only orgasm if I imagined being murdered while she was having an orgasm on someone else in the same room. I forget about this part sometimes. Damn dissociative memory. \\n\\nShe is confused or dishonest a lot. Noble intention. Her words contradict each other. Think I’m going crazy. Or being gaslit?\\n\\nAfter the last time I yelled it broke her. She no longer feels safe. I don’t blame her. She wants a divorce. I don’t. I love her so much. \\n\\nI miss her so much. I don’t know how we got here, whose fault it is, or what we could of done to have stopped it. But I hate being here. \\n\\nI miss you babe. You were saying we were soulmates. Now we’re roommates. I fucked up. \\n\\nI don’t even know if us staying together would be good for either of us. Are you just stronger than me? I promised I’d never leave you. I want us to be happy. I don’t know if I was a good husband or not. Or a good friend. \\n\\nYou’ve been through so much in your life too. I hope you make your life what you want of it.', 'Flair': 'Relationships'}, 'Post 5': {'Title': 'social anxiety is ruining a possible relationship', 'Text': 'So I M(15) and a girl I\\'ve been talking to F(14) , we\\'ve been talking for about 2 months, and we like each other alot, she is very good looking and funny, smart, all that. In middle school I was relentlessly bullied and hurt, because of my 6th grade gf. So believe it or not I was a edgy 6th grader who wanted attention and I said some dumb things for attention, and eventually after like a year she left me, admitted she had been having sex with a high schooler. So I was sad, and mad, and in my anger I said I could tell everyone she had sex with a high schooler.\\n\\n She took it horribly as you would guess and she told everyone all the stupid lies I said and I was horribly bullied for the rest of middle school, dont get me wrong I deserved it for a bit, but halfway through 7th I was a different person and realized what I did and I felt bad. But I was in a horribly cringey \"nerd\" group for the rest of middle school and I hated almost all of them.\\n\\n On the last day of 8th as i was walking home i cried tears of joy realizing I\\'m out of that friend group. It wasn\\'t until I was out of middle school when i realized i have severe social anxiety, and for the first few months of freshman, I didnt care. It has ruined my relationship with my family, whenever they say something I  mumble and shrug, say idk and its not just them, its everyone but my friends I do this to. \\n\\nMy grades are bad because of it, I dont ask for help and I have no motivation to do work, I just hate my life and myself for being such a social reject, people talk to me and they will say something funny, and I feel like I know what to say back but I just cant and I mumble or just smile and shrug. I hate it. So at the start of freshman, this girl I looked at in class all the time came up to me at the end of class and nervously walked up to me and asked for my snap, I typed it in and she walked out.\\n\\n I was so nervous and excited because that was the first time a girl has asked for my snap since 6th grade. Another thing to add, my friends target me and bully me, and they gave me shit for being nervous when that happened. When I got on the bus she texted me and we texted all the time and it was nice. \\n\\nHomecoming was coming up and she really wanted me to go but I was too nervous and just tried to brush her off even though I liked her. I was just too anxious to commit and I kept trying to brush her off. Her and her friend would come up and talk to me and flirt with me and obviously I would just shrug and mumble. But my friend said if I went with her he would go with her friend so I went, she looked so good in her dress, and we had a good time, although of course I said almost nothing to her.\\n\\n We danced together at the end ,and then I left. For more weeks, her and her friend would sit down with me and talk to me, and yup I still mumbled and shrugged and idked. Now on the text side of things with her, she was opening up to me and talked about things that have happned in her life, and I\\'m pretty good at helping people, so I comforted her over text and let her talk about it. \\n\\nI\\'m not going to say anything about her problems. So we were becoming closer and closer over text, yet in person I just couldn\\'t speak still. Eventually she stopped talking to me in person and said if I dont talk, she wont talk, and i said that\\'s fair, I\\'ve told her about why i mumble and shrug and she understands and promises that she wont lose interest and stay until I\\'m able to talk to her.\\n\\n I want to let you all know, she is very attractive and alot of guys and even good looking ones like her and they all actually are able to talk to her and make her laugh, and it makes me jealous but we arent dating so I try not to let it affect me. To Me, she has way better options and I still dont understand why, but she still chooses me, she still wants me and she promises she wont give up on me. Well recently her older sister said that until I can talk to her, we should just be friends, and that made her sad but thought it was reasonable, and I just agreed.\\n\\n More and more she responds less over text, never looks at me in class, talks and laughs with other guys. It makes me feel like shes losing interest but she is promising she isnt, and to let you know because of a suicide of one of her very close friends, she is very serious about promises and they mean alot to her so I know she is serious. Also, her friends have left her recently over something stupid. \\n\\nSo now she lost her friend group. The past few days she responds very 30 mins to an hour and has been acting kinda different, and I think it\\'s because her sister tried to kill herself, her friends left her, and her mom isnt that nice to her, I\\'ve been helping her through it but idk if I\\'m helping. I started taking ashwagandha ksm anxiety medicine so I can be able to talk to her, but it\\'s been a week of 2 pills every morning and I\\'m noticing no changes in my social anxiety, and my grades are horrible and idk what to do. I just want to be able to talk to her so so bad. I want to be able to have a good relationship with her one day, I just want to be comfortable around her. Someone help me because if this anxiety medince doesn\\'t work then i dont know what I\\'m gonna do. Help.\\n\\nUPDATE: Her sister talked to her again and said we should be friends, again. Shes been texting me less and just now she said her ex broke up with his gf and he wants to be with her, and that he wants to hang out, so she is probably gonna go back with him, and she said she wanted to but wont and when I asked why she said I\\'m not allowed to know. I got in a fight today and punched my friend in the face and now I\\'m suspended. All my friends have now left me and my anxiety medicine has yet to work. The last few days, she told me to take a week to myself, to not text her for a week. I just know shes been texting her ex and probably already went and hung out with him, idk though. She had a photo of her saved in our chat and deleted it today, idk why. I just want to text her but I cant. I have nobody else since my friends left. I\\'ve realized since I dont have much else, I want to make it my goal to be able to talk to her and be with her.', 'Flair': 'Family/Relationship'}}, 'positivity': {'Post 1': {'Title': 'Shall we believe in astrology or not?', 'Text': '**Shall we believe in astrology or not?**\\n\\nAstrology is a part of the subject of God (spiritual philosophy) although it is often misunderstood to be a field unrelated to the subject of God. You must also distinguish between astronomy and astrology. Astronomy deals with the inert planets that we see in the sky. Astrology deals with the subject of the presiding deities of these planets, which control the administration of the world. \\n\\nYour house is like the inert physical planet whereas you, the house-owner having awareness, are like the presiding deity. The planet is made of energy and matter. The presiding deity is an energetic being having an energetic body and a soul (awareness). The deity also possesses the necessary unimaginable powers granted by God for carrying out the administration of the world. \\n\\nThe planet is visible to our eyes whereas the presiding deity is invisible to our eyes. The nine planets considered in astrology belong to the category of energy and matter. The respective presiding deities of the planets belong to the category of awareness or soul. They are divine beings having invisible energetic bodies and souls and they possess some unimaginable powers. Whenever someone refers to the moon, we understand it only in the sense of the inert planet moon (satellite). We laugh when we are told that the moon controls our mind. \\n\\nHere, we are missing the point that the statement refers to the presiding deity of the inert moon called Chandra. In Sanskrit and most Indian languages, the same word Chandra is used to indicate both the inert moon as well as its presiding deity (Moon). When used in the sense of controlling the mind, Chandra (Moon) means the presiding deity and not the inert moon in the sky. \\n\\nThe same applies to all the other astrological planets. The names of the inert planets are the same as the names of their presiding deities. Atheistic scientists, mock at the field of astrology since they are not able to distinguish between the inert planet and its presiding deity. Even if they were explained about the difference between the two, it would be of no use since they do not believe in the existence of the presiding deities of the inert planets.\\n\\nOfficers in the Divine Administration\\n\\nThe nine planets are the personifications of various unimaginable powers of the unimaginable God. They form the various specialized departments in the administrative office of God and they carry out their respective function in the administration of the world. Being the unimaginable powers of God themselves, the planets are not different from the unimaginable God qualitatively; even though they are different quantitatively. \\n\\nThis means that the planet has a part of the unimaginable power of God and is completely controlled by God like an employed officer. Each planet controls a specific aspect of the soul and of the rest of the world. Hence, the planet can be assumed and treated to be a part of God Himself. The system of planets ruling the world under the orders of God can be compared to the secretariat of the chief minister ruling the state under the orders of the chief minister. This secretariat of God has different departments, each dealing with a specific aspect of the world and of the souls residing in the world. The entire administration follows the constitution of God. \\n\\nThe presiding deity of the planet is called a graha in Sanskrit. Graha commonly means the physical inert planet. But the word planet (graha) when used in astrology, means the presiding deity of that planet. Graha, in the sense of its root-word, means ‘that which catches’ (gṛhṇāti iti grahaḥ). It actually means the energetic divine being, who is an embodiment of a certain unimaginable power of God and who ‘catches’ the soul.\\n\\nThe presiding deity of the planet (graha) ‘catches’ the soul to deliver the rewards of the soul’s good deeds and the punishments of sins at the exact stipulated time. The human soul can never escape from being caught by the presiding deities of the planets, however much the soul may try. Above these planets exist eight higher divine officers called as the Aṣṭadikpālakās. They are Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirṛti, Varuṇa, Vāyu, Kubera, and Īshāna. Above them exist the Five Principal Authorities called as the Pañcalokapālakās. They are Gaṇapati, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva and Śakti. All of them are energetic beings associated with unimaginable powers of God and all of them are invisible to human beings.\\n\\nPlanets Deliver the Fruits of the Soul’s Deeds\\n\\nAstrology helps a person accept the existence of God. It helps souls experience the unimaginable powers of God that control various aspects of the life of any living being. When souls receive the fruits of their deeds, they realize the existence of the unimaginable powers of God. The existence of God’s unimaginable powers ultimately establishes the existence of the unimaginable God, who is the Source and Controller of those powers. This case is similar to the case of miracles establishing the existence of God. \\n\\nWitnessing unimaginable miracles in this world establishes the existence of the unimaginable power of God, which in turn establishes the existence of its Source. This ultimate Source of the unimaginable power is the unimaginable God (Parabrahman). Hence, astrology should not be treated as a field that is independent of spiritual philosophy. Some astrologers, eliminating God, treat the nine planets to be the most supreme powers. They treat them to be the highest authorities like a board of directors. Actually, God is the supreme authority and He controls all the presiding deities of the planets. These only planets work under the orders of their Chief Boss called God.\\n\\nIt is a total misunderstanding that planets give results due to their movements. The planets do not give accidental results by their movements. The results that the planets give to souls are only the fruits of the deeds of the souls. The movements of the planets are just incidental in giving the fruits of the deeds of the soul. A thief says that he was arrested by the policeman, who was walking on the road since he (thief) went on that road! This is absurd. \\n\\nThis fellow had committed the crime of theft and policemen were already searching for him. This search for the sinner is expressed as the movements of the planets. Actually, in the real concept, the planet (deity) need not search for the sinner. The planet has the unimaginable power to locate the sinner on the stipulated date and at the stipulated time. Philosophers and scholars say that God punished the sinner. \\n\\nOrdinary people say that the planets punished the sinner. Both are one and the same. It is one and the same whether one says that the government or the chief minister punished the criminal or whether one says that the police punished the criminal. Some astrologers feel that the whole administration functions due to the governance of this board of nine directors called the planets. For these astrologers, God is irrelevant and they act like atheists. But since they accept the existence of the unimaginable power of the planet in doing its administrative task, they are theists indirectly! \\n\\nThe difference between astrologers and priests arose due to the difference in their business activity. The priest says that your difficulty will be removed if you worship God. The astrologer says that your difficulty will be removed if you worship the planet. It is just the difference between their ways of earning money from people. \\n\\nA partnership in business also exists between the astrologers and priests. The astrologer sometimes says that a certain planet should be worshipped with the help of the priest. Thus, a partnership business is established. The doctor writes a prescription for several tests to be conducted in diagnostic laboratories and receives a commission from the laboratories. Business and the cheating of the innocent public have spread everywhere. People want to earn money illegally but they do not realize that it will only lead to the destruction of themselves and their families in the course of time.\\n\\nShri Swami’s Father: A Great Astrologer\\n\\nMy father was a very famous astrologer. He never said that the planet should be worshiped through a priest. He always advised the clients to directly perform the worship of the planets on their own. The priest will not have much interest in your issue because the attention of many priests is only on the remuneration that you will give to them. So, My father always advised people to worship the forms of God, which preside the planets as per the Jaimini Sūtras. Note that the inert planet has a presiding deity by the same name of the planet. \\n\\nBut that presiding deity of the planet is also presided over by higher divine beings and forms of God. For instance, God Viṣṇu presides over Sun. Here Sun means the presiding deity of the inert sun. Similarly, Goddess Lakṣmi presides over Moon and Venus. God Śiva presides over Jupiter. God Viṣṇu presides over Mercury and Saturn. God Skanda (Subrahmaṇya) presides over Mars, Rāhu and Ketu. Goddess Durgā also presides over Rahu and Ketu. In this manner, My father would introduce devotion to God through astrology. \\n\\nAnother remedy suggested by him was the distribution of food items to beggars. The food items to be distributed are made from grains that are specific to each planet. For example, wheat is for Sun, rice is for Moon, red gram is for Mars and so on. This remedy encourages donation to the poor. If anybody offered money to My father, he would refuse it saying that he is already getting a salary from the college, where he worked as a lecturer of Telugu and Sanskrit. \\n\\nHe used to say that since he is not rich, he is performing this free service to earn the grace of God with the help of his brain. If such an attitude exists in every astrologer, society will be reformed shortly. At least astrologers and priests should not demand money from their customers. They should accept whatever is given by the customer. Due to this selfless service, every prediction made by My father would come true, due to the grace of God. There would always be a lot of rush of people before My house, waiting for the consultation with My father. The death of My father was also wonderful. On Vyāsa Purṇimā (Guru Purṇimā) day, he took a bath in the evening, worshiped God as usual, gave his astrological consultations to all his clients, and suddenly breathed his last at 7.00 pm, upon seeing the full moon. \\n\\nMy mother too never pressed My father for earning more money even though several other astrologers were earning a lot. Due to this, My mother also breathed her last upon seeing the full Moon at 7.00 pm on Aśviyuja Purṇimā, which comes just after Vijayadashami, the festival of the Divine Mother. She passed away holding a small picture of God Datta in her closed hand.\\n\\nAvoid Mixing Astronomy with Astrology\\n\\nThe concepts of astronomy should not be confused with the concepts of astrology. The eclipse of the sun and the moon are astronomical events and not astrological concepts. Priests, who are supported by astrologers, extend their concepts to the field of astronomy saying that you should not eat food during the time of an eclipse.\\n\\nIf the astronomer mocks at the priest and the astrologer for this unduly extended concept, there is no harm. But if the astronomer is an atheist and due to his atheism, proceeds to mock at the presiding deities of the planets and God, he will surely face punishment for it. This punishment received by such atheists is again misinterpreted by the priest who is supported by the astrologer. \\n\\nThey again extend their concept of God’s punishment into the field of astronomy by saying that the punishment received by the atheist came for eating food during the forbidden time of the eclipse. In reality, the punishment was for mocking at the planetary deity and God. Even if you speak against the planet (deity), you have insulted God since the planet is part and parcel of God’s power.\\n\\nPunishments Cancelled Upon Reformation; Not by Worship\\n\\nNow let us take the issue raised by you. You are wondering how the punishments for one’s sins, which come in the form of worldly problems, get cancelled by worshiping the planets or God? Are we trying to flatter the planets or God, so that we can be excused from the punishment? In that case, a criminal would only have to flatter the judge to get his punishment reduced or cancelled! Does God cancel the punishments of sin by such flattering worship and prayers? Absolutely not! This concept is totally wrong. When you worship God (or the planet), God merely postpones your sin to a later period of time with increased interest. You think that God has cancelled your punishment because you are unable to differentiate between postponement and cancelation. \\n\\nAfter removing your immediate difficulty through this postponement, He also gives you the benefit for which you had prayed. Receiving the desired benefit gives you happiness. You think that God gave you your desired benefit due to your talented and well-acted flattery in your prayers, even though you had not done any good deed. \\n\\nAgain, this concept is also wrong! God prematurely withdrew the fruit of one of your good deeds, which was supposed to be enjoyed by you in the future. That future benefit is granted to you in the present time, in the form desired by you. But in this premature withdrawal, there is a loss in the value of the benefit. It is like the premature withdrawal of a bank deposit, in which there is a reduction in its value. \\n\\nActually, God arranges the punishments for our bad deeds and the rewards for our good deeds in an alternating manner in each of our life cycles. In this arrangement, the actual sequence when we performed the good and bad deeds is neglected. This alternating arrangement gives maximum enjoyment to us. One gets maximum enjoyment on tasting sweet and hot dishes in an alternate manner. \\n\\nIf one eats only sweet dishes one after the other or only hot and spicy dishes one after the other, one gets bored. The sweet dishes are like the good fruits and the hot dishes are like the bad fruits. Their alternate arrangement made by God in each lifetime for our maximum enjoyment, is a favor done by God the Father, who has boundless love for His children (souls). \\n\\nBy praying to God to remove present problems and give some benefits, we are praying for God to reduce our enjoyment! God in His infinite wisdom and kindness has already made the best possible arrangement of the fruits of our deeds, which will provide us with maximum enjoyment and benefit. By such prayers, we are only proving our own foolishness! \\n\\nGod is not a fool to be flattered like a king by poets in his court! The question comes why God is cheating us like this? We pray to Him to remove our problems and give us our desired benefits. But He merely prepones and postpones some of our fruits, which causes a loss to us. Of course, the straight answer to the question is that you tried to cheat Him through your flattery, so you are being cheated in return! But apart from this simple answer, there is another point. Even though you are cheated by God in return for your cheating, the rearrangement of the fruits of your deeds has a beneficial angle. \\n\\nYou will develop a lot of faith and devotion to God due to it. Since you do not know the actual background or rearrangement, you think that God did both these favors to you even though you did not deserve them. You think that God removed your present punishment, which as per the rule, must be suffered by you. God also granted you a good fruit even though you had not done any good deed from your side. Even though it is a crooked path in which you get undeserved favors from God, it gradually increases your faith and devotion in God. \\n\\nWhen your devotion increases sufficiently, you may get spiritual knowledge from God. The spiritual knowledge is the only solution that will reform you permanently. \\n\\nOnce you have reformed permanently, there is no further need to punish you. So, all the pending punishments, which had been postponed from previous births and have grown in interest, will be cancelled. The logic behind the cancelation of the pending punishments is that punishment is meant only for reformation and not for revenge. As a lawyer, you will understand all this legal procedure of the divine constitution. Hence, worshipping God does not in any way interfere with the doctrine of the cycle of deeds and fruits (karma).\\n\\nMostly, the people believe in unimaginable events and unimaginable God with 50—50 probability in both philosophy and astrology. A philosopher salutes God in the temple that comes on the way thinking that nothing is lost by saluting God, even if He does not exist and some favour may be achieved if God exists. A similar believer in astrology also thinks that if a work is started in auspicious time, nothing is lost even if the astrology is false. In case, the astrology is correct, the auspicious time may help him. Similarly, the rules of house construction(Vastu). This concept of 50—50 probability is the basic ruling faculty of the psychology of almost all the modern human beings.\\n\\nThe auspicious time and rules of the construction of house involve the concept of unimaginable relationship. The faith in unimaginable God is founded by such unimaginable concepts and unimaginable events called miracles. Thus, astrology serves as the subject introducing the unimaginable concept proved through unimaginable events. The philosophy gives weight to the unimaginable events done by God in the name of miracles. The astrological predictions are also experienced by several generations of humanity and are not different from miracles. Building the faith in the unimaginable God through such unimaginable concepts experienced is the main motto of the astrology, which forms the basic part of the spiritual knowledge. If you say that the predictions of astrology are false, the miracles are also said to be false. The common area of foundation of unimaginable concept exists in both the fields to the same extent.\\n\\nScientists do not believe astrology due to the misunderstanding that the inert planets in the space control the human life. Certainly, science is correct since such misunderstood concept is impossible and wrong. The real concept is that the unimaginable powers of God called as planets are only controlling the human beings. Since science keeps silent about the unimaginable concept, science does not negate astrology, but, is silent about astrology in the real light of the true concept. Atheists negate astrology because they negate God also since they discard the unimaginable concept. Philosophers also keep silent about astrology feeling that the planets are different from the controlling powers of God called deities with different names. They accept the deities but not the planets. In fact, the presiding deity of planet and controlling deity in philosophy are one and the same. Philosophy speaks about the deity Yama and Astrology says the same Yama as Shani (Saturn). Both are sons of the Sun only. Saturn is said to be deity of knowledge (Jnana kaaraka). Yama also gave excellent spiritual knowledge to Nachiketa. Hence, the contents are the same and the names are only different.\\n\\nAstrology is based on planets with unimaginable powers given by God to do the routine administration of world under the total control of God. The ladder up to God is built starting from the bottommost ground of atheists.\\n\\nAtheists do not believe in the existence of unimaginable God and hence in the unimaginable power. To create belief in the mind of an atheist, miraculous powers of God are exhibited, which indicate the existence of ultimate unimaginable God as their source. All these exhibitors of miraculous powers of God indicate the distance travelled by you in the path to God like the milestones. These milestones are meant for exhibiting the concept of unimaginable power and thereby indicating the concept of unimaginable God as its source, which are called as aativaahikas meaning the guides showing you the direction of the path towards God.\\n\\nThese travel guides possess miraculous powers to introduce the concept of unimaginable power of God. The Brahma Sutra says that these guides (aativaahikaah) possess the characteristic power of unimaginable God (tat lingaat) by which they show the direction towards God. Once you reach the goal, these guides are not necessary for you. But, since you have reached the goal, will you say that all the milestones in the path are unnecessary and should be removed? You must respect them for the sake of the other travelers in the path. These powers introduce the possessor of these powers.\\n\\nWhen a prediction given by astrology as per the astrological scriptures written by sages like Paraashara and Jaimini becomes correct, you cannot attribute this prediction to the imaginable scientific power. Hence, you will accept the existence of the unimaginable power, which is an introduction to the acceptance of unimaginable God. God also makes the astrological prediction to become correct since He likes to establish the concept of unimaginable power in the mind of an atheist so that gradually the atheist becomes theist and attains the faith in God. When you have recognized God and involved in His service through advanced spiritual knowledge, astrology is not necessary for you. But, astrology helps the other travelers in the spiritual path. Even exhibitors of miracles also are in this direction only. Even demons exhibiting the miracles serve this main purpose and hence, are not objected by God. The negative direction of the miracles taken by them will destroy them.\\n\\nAstrologers also in the service of God are helped by God in making their prediction to become true. But, astrologers exploiting (for money) the weakness of theists for solutions of problems and materialistic benefits are punished by God. All the miracles are meant for the beginner in the LKG class, the level of atheism only. The theist does not require any miracle since he already believes the existence of God with miraculous powers. The theist acts like an atheist demanding for a miracle so that once he recognizes the place of existence of miraculous power, he can flatter and wash the brain of the possessor of miraculous powers through unreal devotion to solve his/her personal problems. God is omniscient and knows all the trickish ideas of human beings. When there is a real necessity, the miraculous power of God is spontaneously exhibited without any effort of the possessor of miraculous power. Hence, if you are a devoted theist, you do not require any miracle or astrology and you require only the perfect spiritual knowledge in order to serve God in perfect way. You need not worry about the solutions of your problems because God will take care of you in every problem without any prayer. The tricks and false devotion with the aim of solutions for problems and materialistic benefits cannot fool God.\\n\\nIf you are praying for removal of the problem, which is the punishment of your sin, your philosophy is to do the sin and not to accept its punishment! If you are praying for materialistic benefits, which are the fruits of good deeds only, it means that your philosophy is to gain the fruit of good deed without doing the good deed!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nwww.universal-spirituality.org\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nUniversal Spirituality for World Peace', 'Flair': 'Inspiration / Encouragement'}, 'Post 2': {'Title': 'WIP A Guide for those at rock bottom/that want improve their mental health/how to improve your life', 'Text': \" \\n\\nJust before we get into it this is a work in progress and is based off of my own experience and what I have learned and how I've implemented it I am not qualified in any type of profession that related to a mental health field. Bit of background about me so you have an idea of where I'm coming from at the start of this year I was prescribed anti depressants and decided I needed to try a sort of life style change before I started taking anti depressants and started taking action, the results were great and my mental health has improved significantly. I don't see people recommending a lot of the things that I found to be the most useful so I started writing this guide, It's far from finished but I think what I have so far will still be valuable to those in a similar position to what I was in. If anyone has any advice one how it could be improved or critiques I would appreciate it\\n\\nStarting point\\n\\nLow point/rock bottom\\n\\nLots of bad habits\\n\\nDirectionless\\n\\nWar between what you want to do and what you feel like doing\\n\\nStep 1 Recognise where you are and where you want to be\\n\\nWrite about your current state:\\n\\nwhat is life like\\n\\nwhat are you failing at by your own definition\\n\\nWhat are you succeeding at by your own definition\\n\\nwhat does your typical day look like\\n\\nWrite about what you want and why you want it:\\n\\nWhat could you do more of\\n\\nWhat could you do less of\\n\\nWhat do you want your typical day to look like\\n\\nWhat do you want to work towards/achieve\\n\\nWrite about what will happen if you don't change and why:\\n\\nWhere will your bad habits lead you\\n\\nWhat will happen to your mental health\\n\\nWhat will happen to your physical health\\n\\nHow will your finances be effected\\n\\nHow will your relationships be affected\\n\\nIt is important to take the time to write about these things and not just think about them, writing will allow you to build a clearer, and bigger, picture of the situation than you can achieve by just thinking about it. Having this written down will also allow you to revisit it in the future and reflect on your progress which will be useful in step 2.\\n\\nStep 2 Game plan\\n\\nNow you have a list of things you want to avoid and integrate into your life with an explanation of why making those changes will be good for you. Now you must come up with a plan of action to start making these changes, to start with we will create a daily routine.\\n\\nWhen it comes to making your routine there are somethings you need to know:\\n\\nA routine is not meant to be a rigid set of rules that mean you have to do x then y and you get no time for yourself\\n\\nYour routine will be changed over time, some things will work and others won't, and so over time parts of your routine will change but you have to try these things before you know what needs to be changed\\n\\nSome things can't be done without first doing something else (for example getting up at 5 can’t be done consistently over night, you start at 8 then 7 30, then 7…) you must start at the bottom if you want to improve\\n\\nConsistency is key but will also come with time, some things will take longer to be consistent with than others so you need to start small and then build up\\n\\nThings to include and how to structure it:\\n\\nSleep Schedule\\n\\nYou must include a consistent wake up and bed time, it does not matter what times you pick only that you become consistent, this is because an unstable sleep schedule will disrupt your bodies internal clock (circadian rhythm), this clock regulates your mood and many other things, mood is key however as the worse your mood is the less likely you’ll want to do the rest of your routine. To make getting into a consistent sleep schedule easier once you wake up you can: go outside for a few minutes when the sun is up, do something to get your heart rate up, do some form of cold exposure (for example cold shower or standing outside with minimal clothing for a few minutes). Getting sunlight is one of the indicators the body uses to figure out what time of day it is and so is great for anchoring the internal clock, getting your heart rate up and cold exposure will raise your core body temperature which will make you feel more awake as during sleep our core body temperature is at its lowest. The other part of having a consistent sleep schedule is having a consistent evening schedule which essentially boils down to going to bed at the same time each night. It is important to remember that time in bed does not mean time asleep so lets say you want to get up at 6 am and want to get 8 hours of sleep, to get those 8 hours you need to be asleep by 10pm so you would want to be in bed at around 9:30pm to make sure you get those 8 hours of sleep. I would also recommend that you don't have any screen time for around 1 hour before you go the bed and use a blue light filter on your devices 2-3 hours before you go to bed all of this helps to tell the body that it is getting close to bedtime and will make it easier to fall asleep and improve the quality of your sleep. An easy way to limit your screen time before bed that I have found useful is to read a book for that hour before you go to bed, if reading isn't for you then you might not have found the right book/type of book yet, a good way to find a book you might like is to look for books on topics you’re interested in, if you are just starting reading I found it helpful to start with a fictional book to get me into the habit. If you’ve never had a consistent sleep schedule then you will have never felt the benefits of having one which include, it being easier to get out of bed in the morning, improved mood, reduced stress, better quality sleep, more energy, and having loads of the biological processes in our body working better such as metabolism and the cardiovascular (heart and blood) system.\\n\\nProgress Tracking\\n\\nAdd in a form of progress tracking, personally I recommend you use a small notebook in which you would write the date, the things you have and have not done (for example get up at 7 tick, meditate tick, workout cross). This will serve four important functions, firstly it will give you a log to look back on and allow you to see your progress which is especially useful once you’ve been keeping it up for a little while as on days where you feel you have failed you can look back and see that you have in fact done much more than you did on the first few days despite the fact that you have done less than yesterday. The second thing this will do is keep you accountable on days where you might not feel like doing x or y as you’ll then have to write i failed x and on most occasions I have found that I decided to just do x as you are almost forced to see that it is your choice if you tick or cross x. The third benefit will also help you to get to grips with your routine as each day you’ll be making a list of the things you’ve done and get you used to the idea of I’ve just got up, I will now do x then y and so on. And finally this will allow you to more easily see the parts of your routine that are problematic and allow you to tweak those things to make them a better fit to your routine or replace them with something else.\\n\\nScheduling Tips\\n\\nSchedule the things you least feel like doing in the morning and in order of resistance, I am not suggesting that you should get up and do those things immediately as you may feel like not getting out of bed if the first thing you are faced with is the hardest thing for you to do. Doing the things you don't want to do in the morning and in order of not wanting to do them will mean that everything after them will be easier comparatively and also stops them from looming over you any longer than necessary we all know what it’s like to have a task we don't want to do so we keep putting it off and during the time we keep avoiding it it’s always in the back of your mind or can be a cause of anxiety, so by doing them first we avoid that. To start with add in 1-3 high resistance activities but ones that you want to do and ones that you would do.\\n\\nI procrastinate/feel the tasks I have set for myself are too much\\n\\nThis is a very common thing that we all go through at some point or another part of this is getting to know what we can and would actually do. The more you practice setting yourself tasks like in the routine that we are in the process of creating the better you will get to know your capabilities and tendencies.To figure out what you would and wouldn't do we can do a simple thought exercise let's say the task is to clean the house but that seems too much, okay am I willing to clean just my bedroom today, still no, okay am I willing to clean my desk, still no, okay am I willing to put the glass left over from yesterday in the dishwasher yes. Essentially you start with the task you want to get done and then break down the steps until they are small enough that you are willing to do them, sure it might take you longer to actually clean the house this way then if you did it all at once but in this example we know that the full task is too much for us at this moment and by doing this we have still made progress towards it that we wouldn’t have if we didn’t break it down.\\n\\nIm not consistent with my routine and I feel bad about it\\n\\nFeeling a sense of guilt or negativity towards yourself for missing certain tasks or parts of your routine is very normal when you are starting out especially if you are suffering with mental health issues. This can be very off putting but before you start insulting yourself because you didn’t go for a walk this morning there are somethings you should be aware of. First of all it is very likely that this is the first time you have tried to get into a routine, we should look at this like it is a skill in a video game the more of it you do the better you get so it is expected that you will fail to stick to your routine in the beginning few months because you are a low level in the “sticking to your routine” skill, at the same time you are going to be quite high in the skill of “not sticking to a routine” so it is expected that you will struggle to start with. But each time you tick off a task you will gain experience in the routine skill and over time you will level it up. As I have said earlier you will need to adjust your routine as you go and this is a part of it. So there are a few things that we can do to help with the negative feelings that come with missing a day or a task, the one I have found to be most impactful is to know that a bad morning doesn't mean the rest of the day has to be bad in fact use this as a source of motivation “I feel bad right now and I’ve missed my morning workout but i'm not going to let the rest of the day be bad” is something along the lines of what i say to myself. This is especially important if you are suffering with depression as it can be very hard to just get out of bed and then you might think to yourself something along the lines of “it’s 1pm I’ve only just managed to get out of bed most of the day is gone I’ve already missed X Y and Z what's the point of trying for the rest of the day” at least this has been my experience, but as I am writing this today I didn't wake up until 11pm and I though what's the point so I went back to sleep and got out of bed at 12pm, got something to eat played some video games for an hour or so and then continued to work on writing this guide, the point is a bad event or a bad start to the day does not mean that the whole day has to be a bad one.\\n\\nThings to try if you are struggling with mental health issues such as depression or anxiety:\\n\\nPhysical Exercise\\n\\nInclude some form of workout in the morning, I know you’ve likely heard this a million times but physical exercise is a great mood booster. Doing this in the morning will give you a mood boost for the next few hours and make the rest of your day that bit easier, as i mentioned before being in a bad mood will mean you’re less likely to continue with the rest of your routine. You can do anything for this workout and you don't need equipment, simply look on youtube for body weight exercises and choose a few that you enjoy doing, it doesn't need to be super intense but you should aim to do enough so that you can feel you’ve worked out the muscles that you have afterwards. An added benefit to doing this in the morning is in short it afterwards you will feel much more awake.\\n\\nGratitude\\n\\nInclude a gratitude practice, having a daily gratitude practice will drastically improve your mental health and can be very quick and easy to do, you can include this at any point in your day however I recommend putting it in the morning, either the thing you do straight after waking up or straight after the 1-3 high resistance activities in your morning. The way this works is by practicing gratitude daily you are essentially training your mind to think more positive and gratitude type thoughts, after a week or so you’ll find that you will be doing some random activity, regardless of its inclusion to your routine, and you will think something like “I am so grateful that…”. The best way I can describe this feeling is, it's like giving your best friend a compliment, you say something to them, see them smile and then you yourself feel great too, that's one of the great things about being human, we are programmed so that doing things for others makes us feel good too. So the quickest and easiest gratitude practice I have found is called gratitude journaling. Simply write down three things that you are grateful for and try not to repeat the same ones everyday, it does not take a long time and there are an infinite list of things to be grateful for and it can be anything. I recommend that you use your progress tracking book to write these things down, as you can then kill two birds with one stone and two habits become one. Having a daily gratitude practice was really one of the things that has gotten me out of depression, I can't recommend this practice enough and it’s important to note that the longer you keep gratitude journaling the bigger the benefits become, if this is something you want to try do it for at least 2 weeks before you decide that it's a waste of time.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read to the end, If anyone has any advice one how it could be improved or critiques I would appreciate it, I hope this is helpful to anyone who needs something like this\", 'Flair': 'Inspiration / Encouragement'}, 'Post 3': {'Title': 'Suicide Shall Be Avoided', 'Text': '  \\n\\n**SUICIDE SHALL BE AVOIDED**\\n\\n**Suicide Shall Be Avoided**\\n\\n“As I told you, the human life is almost impossible. The Christianity and Islam do not agree re-human birth. In Hinduism the re-human birth is admitted but it is said to be very rare. When the same God is the speaker of all the religions, there cannot be contradiction. Therefore, this means the re-human birth is generally impossible. But the omnipotent God can sanction the re-human birth to a soul if there is a hope of its upliftment. The human birth is meant for the human being having interest in spiritual knowledge. It does not mean mere human form. \\n\\nEating, sleep, emotions related to the environment and sex to produce children are common to both human beings and animals (Ahara Nidra Bhaya Mithunani…). The human birth with spiritual knowledge and coming in contact with the human incarnation happens only once. Such a human birth is called as Brahmana. Here this word is not at all related to the present caste system. The Brahmana means the human being belonging to any caste having full interest in the spiritual field and comes in contact with the human form of the Lord with faith so that he attains the perfect spiritual knowledge (Brahma Jnanam). If such chance is missed, he will be born as Kshatriya who believes only in his effort and efficiency with full egoism.\\n\\nThe next birth is Vysya having over attachment to wealth. The next birth is Sudra who is always selfish. The next birth is fisherman (Ganga putra) in which he kills the fish in the water. The next birth is hunter (vyadha) who kills the animals in the forest. The last birth of human form is Chandala who kills even the animals that served him. Thus, the soul descends by seven births and finally enters the cycle of animals, birds , worms etc.\\n\\nThe soul existing as Brahmana will never commit suicide. The souls of other levels only commit suicides due to problems in the world. The Brahmana will never commit suicide because he is well aware of the main divine aim of the human life. Even if the soul of other types is alive there is very little chance of its upliftment. Veda says that by committing suicide the soul enters the world of permanent darkness which means ignorance (asuryanaamate…). This means that the soul directly enters the cycle of animals etc., on committing suicide. Thus there is only one chance of the birth of Brahmana for a soul, which means that there is only one chance for any soul to have the real fruitful human birth in which it can meet the human incarnation. \\n\\nIn the other births the soul has only a very tiny trace of chance to meet and recognize the human form of the Lord in true spirit. All ready when the possibility of the upliftment of self is a trace only, if suicide is committed, it looses that trace of chance also. Thus, one in seven persons can only recognize the human form of the God in the right spirit of the upliftment of the self. The other human beings do not recognize at all and even if they recognize, they try to use the Lord for the worldly matters only.\\n\\nThe real suicide is that when the soul is not trying for its spiritual upliftment and always is dragged by the worldly affairs only. Such a soul will become a lizard which is always watching for an insect to eat. All its concentration is on the insect only. Gopikas jumped into fire after hearing the death of Krishna. But it is not suicide, because they have realized the main aim of the human life, which is the Lord only. What is the use of a soul always immersed in worldly affairs and worldly bonds only? Such a soul has really committed suicide already because the soul killed itself (Naatmaana mavasadayet-Gita). \\n\\nWhen the sage Sanatsujata came to Dhrutarashtra, Dhrutarashtra asked him about the death. Then the sage told that the real death is that by which the soul forgets God and is completely immersed in the world (Pramadakhyo Mrurtyuh). Thus, the soul which leaves without any contact with God is already a dead soul, which committed suicide. Gopikas are immortal even though they have committed suicide since they sacrificed their lives for the love of God. This gross body is just like a shirt according to Gita (Vasamsi Jirnani..). Therefore, committing suicide is not a big thing for a realized soul. It is just like changing the cloth. But the purpose for which the suicide is committed is very very important. If the purpose is due to any worldly matter, the soul is thrown in to the permanent hell. The reason for this is that the soul has to detach from the world and attach itself to God.\\n\\nInstead of doing this, the soul is disturbed due to over attachment to the world and is committing suicide. In the memory of Krishna, Radha became mad and wandered in the Brindavanam without food and water. She finally died in the madness of Krishna. That is suicide due to over attachment to God, but the consequence of such sacrifice of life is divine and has immortal fruit.\\n\\nJesus also sacrificed His life for the sake of God. He said that if one does not carry on his own cross for the sake of God, he cannot be the dearest devotee of God. Gita says that a real devotee will even give up the life for the sake of God (Matgata Pranah….). Therefore, the consequence of suicide for any worldly matter is only the permanent hell. When Meera was given poison, she swallowed it and was saved by the Lord. Hanuman tore His heart with His own nails to show Lord in His heart. All these cases of attempt of suicide but have immense spiritual value. Dhrutarashtra lived hundred and twenty years but he has already committed suicide, even though he was alive, because he did not listen to the advice of Lord Krishna even in the worldly matter. \\n\\n## The Veda says that a soul committing suicide will fall in the hell\\n\\nThe Veda says that a soul committing suicide will fall in the hell called ‘Asurya’, which is totally filled by darkness (Asurya Naama te lokaah). You may argue that you are ending your life due to problems. Problems should be solved with courage derived from the devotion to God. In the higher plane of philosophy, you should learn to enjoy the problems along with peace in the life like alternate hot dishes and sweet dishes in the meals. Anything running continuously will result in getting bored, which is also a problem. You cannot enjoy the sweets continuously without a hot dish. You cannot enjoy the cinema with happy scenes only without tragic scenes. Problem is a valuable interval in continuous peace like the pickle in eating a sweet continuously.  \\n \\n\\nThe creation of God in which life is a part is always wonderful. Hence, you should be entertained continuously by the alternate peace and disturbance. In fact, God has created this universe for His entertainment only as said in the Veda (Ekaaki Naramate…). You are enjoying the scenes of problems in the cinema and you must enjoy more the same problem appearing in your life due to direct involvement. You will enjoy more by eating the food instead of enjoying by seeing somebody eating the food. This is the reason that why God was not satisfied with the entertainment attained by seeing His running creation. God takes human form to enter the creation and is entertained perfectly by directly involving Himself in the positive and negative events of life. If you enjoy your life on this earth like God in human form, you are equivalent to God in this aspect of enjoyment. Creation, maintenance and dissolution of this Universe are unnecessary botheration since the final aim of these three aspects is only continuous entertainment. This is perfect monism (Advaita) preached by Shankara.  \\n \\n\\nTherefore, you require the spiritual knowledge to understand the philosophy of life and this total creation. You should always wish to live more time by taking proper care of your health (Jeevema sharadasshatam – Veda). Some ignorant people feel shy in taking the help of medicines and doctors feeling that such way is not spiritual. They pray God to cure the illness and pose that they are in the real spiritual path. It shows only their ignorance. God is the Creator of the Science (Vijnaanam etat sarvam janaardanaat) and its results are given by Him only to the living beings, which are His children (Aham Bijapradah pita). When the problem can be solved through natural power, why should you be rigid of the unnecessary miraculous power of God? Both are His powers only. The natural power is called as Prakriti and the miraculous power is called as Maya. Basically both are His power only and thus, there is no difference between them from that point of view. The Gita says that Maya and Prakriti are one and the same (Mayaam tu prakritim viddhi). If Prakriti fails, you can approach God for exhibition of Maya\\n\\n## The soul becomes hero when it is backed by God. \\n\\nToday even a mosquito is killing the man by giving dangerous fever. The man used to say, “I will quash you like a mosquito.” This means that mosquito is the most negligible creature. But today the mosquito has become an instrument of Yama (Lord of death) to kill the people! What is the reason for this? The situation is reversed. The souls must realize now about their own real strength. It has become zero. If the zero has a number behind it, it gets value of ten, hundred, thousand etc. But when the number becomes absent, any numbers of zeros are zeros only. The soul becomes hero when it is backed by God. Arjuna (Disciple of Lord Krishna) realized this after the exit of Krishna. He could not save Gopikas (Devotees of Lord Krishna) from hunters in a forest and then he realized that he has become zero, since Krishna who is like the back number disappeared. \\n\\nHe was thinking that he was a hero when he killed all the kauravas (demons) in the battlefield. Then he was backed by the Lord. The real worship of God disappeared. \\n\\n## The main aim of life\\n\\nYou are admitted in the college and your main aim is to get the degree. If you fail in the exams your main aim is upset, therefore, you should not get tension. Similarly you should have tension if the main aim of the human life i.e., to achieve the grace of God, fails. Except that, all this family life and relationships are only extra curricular activities. In your college life, a game is conducted as an extra curricular activity.\\n\\nSuppose you are defeated in it. You should take it sportively and not seriously, because that is not the main aim. Therefore take everything in life sportively, because, this life is not the ultimate aim. If family life only is the goal, even animals and birds have their family lives. The speciality of human life is to think and achieve the grace of God.\\n\\n## Realize the main aim of this human life \\n\\nI once again tell you to realize the main aim of this human life and forget the insult in the side activity. For a student the education is the main activity and he should be upset if he fails in the unit tests. But, he should not be worried, if he fails in a game conducted as an extra-curricular activity in the college. All this worldly life is only a game of extra-curricular activity only. If you fail in your efforts to achieve the grace of the Lord, you shall get tension because the spiritual effort is the main activity and aim of this human life.\\n\\nOthello killed Desidimona and ended his life also doubting her character and his doubt was actually unreal. But I assuredly tell you that this entire worldly life made of these unreal dramatic bonds is really unreal and even if Desdimona is wrong, if Othello is a realized soul, he will neglect the total issue as an extra-curricular activity.\\n\\nLove in free atmosphere alone is worthy and in a compelled atmosphere the hypocritic love is useless. Before matter, energy is negligible because energy condensed is matter. Before energy, awareness (soul) is negligible, which is the weakest form of energy. Before awareness the feeling is negligible, which is only the wave of awareness. Qualitatively matter and energy are one and the same energy. But quantitative difference brings the negligence to be treated as almost unreal (Mithya). These bonds are feelings only and you can laugh at these bonds as said in the Gita (karmabandham prahasyasi).\\n\\n1) You are wasting all Your energies in the worldly issues only like pouring the scent water in ash. You must know that Your energy is limited. *Your digestive system is also with limited efficiency and hence, it can’t digest the food continuously and liberate continuous energy.* The time is also very limited in the form of Your life. Hence, *the energy and time are most valuable items, which should be dedicated in the work of God at least partially, if not totally in the initial stage*. The reality is that You are wasting all Your energy and all Your time in the worldly affairs only.\\n\\n2) *Sainthood (Samnyasa) is the highest spiritual state in which all the energy and time are utilized for God only and not at all for the world.* The saint leaves even the basic worldly responsibilities for the sake of My work. I take complete care of a saint and never allow him to suffer for anything provided there is reality in his sainthood. The saint cuts all the worldly bonds including the three strongest worldly bonds called as ‘*Eshanas*’. I always move with them as their servant, always taking the dust of their feet on My head.\\n\\n3) These saints are totally concentrated on Me only because they have the full spiritual knowledge about Me. More the knowledge of the details of an item, more shall be the interest on that item. *If You have full details about Me, You will have full interest on Me.* If You have a few details only about Me, You will have a little interest on Me. *The knowledge is directly proportional to the interest or devotion.* The devotion is directly proportional to the practical sacrifice and practical service. These three states are existing subsequently one after the other as presented by Shankara, Ramanuja and Madhva. *The saint preaches all the spiritual knowledge and in the end, remains silent, which shall not be misunderstood by You as the rest taken by the saint!* Silence is the best expression of the original unimaginable God.\\n\\nWWW.universal-spirituality.org\\n\\nUniversal Spirituality for World Peace', 'Flair': 'Inspiration / Encouragement'}, 'Post 4': {'Title': 'The 2 Years of Curses: or, life lessons from a teenager.

There is no stone unturned, neither forest or unseen spots left to be appreciated. The only thing everybody around me, the community I am raised in, values in life is to breed, live, and die. They value family traditions, the sense of importance in a society, money, and \"love.\" Such love is mostly an imprint of their own personal traits onto their children so they die without the regret of contributing nothing significant in their lives. I didn\\'t have much say. They only looked at my needs from a materialistic surface and their own physical gain. And as I grew up, countless senseless social trends rose as a consequence of globalism and the people I used to trust turned into ideological slaves.\\n\\n\"Omg blank pink k pop band lisaa!!\", \"Far right chad far left virgin!?!\", \"Andrew tate top G this,\" \"unspoken rizz that!!!\" “HE IS THE HIGH-VALUE MAN!!” And their definition of love, oh my god, they don\\'t even love it for the sake of loving somebody; they think it is a *responsibility* to get into a relationship at the age of 15.\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m a boomer for my age, like how people of the past seemed to dislike cultures of the present, but the lack of real human communication where things are spoken genuinely and without 50 layers of post-irony for the express purpose of gaining a footing in communities is suffocating\\n\\nI hated how others lived, and how I did too. I still do, just in a different way.\\n\\nAnd with the realization of this hatred, which became more passive as an acknowledgement of the nature of the world, I fell deep in love with writing. More specifically, stories. Stories that painted a brighter hue to this reality, stories that express genuineness, stories that give meaning to an existentialistic life. And soon, it became apparent that my sole reason for living was for stories. I wanted to understand others\\' stories, mine, and how the ones I\\'ve read emanated warmth. I wanted to make people understand, wholeheartedly and without the constraints of a societal ego, how I really felt. But then I said, \"I\\'m going to write on how people should live!\"\\n\\nIt was a mistake. Motivated by my *own* ego: an intense hatred I experienced everyday at every time and every second, I pushed myself on a long journey. Theorizing and analyzing every nook and cranny there was to the significance of every living being and friend in my vicinity, all their words and the slightest of actions that suggested scrutiny against me; the nature of the human \"ego,\" freewill and utter bullshit. For months on end, I was distrustful of the people I met everyday; how they were flawed, pitiful sinners and how I better not be one. But I was one. This realization drove me deeper into a rabbit hole of truth that I became addicted to, and the changing of my standards every now and then which tried to justify my existence. Sometimes, which became most often times, I convinced myself that masturbating was good and my porn addiction skyrocketed to make me \"motivated.\" I rejected the concept of intimate love, deeming it the weak\\'s unself-reliant way of living. I couldn\\'t distinguish whether it was my ego or my own volition speaking, and I had what felt like nervous breakdowns for an entire week on the very last before the final exams; hypersensitive, blaming others for the fruits of my own actions.\\n\\nAfter all was done, a silence fell on me. I was calm, desensitized.\\n\\nI did not write anything substantial in a year.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI only started rebuilding August of last year, from what was left of my writing skills. In fact, I could barely write. And all I got from that journey was some extra, usable writing material.\\n\\nLess than a page a day for a year wasted.\\n\\nMy intrusive thoughts that I gained didn\\'t help: oughting to distract me with the habits of masturbation, lusting over people I personally knew, and the instinctual urge to make myself distinct from others. I was trapped in a cycle of lust and clout-chasing. I couldn\\'t get anything out there, because I wasn\\'t true.

Else, the fraud of enlightenment.', 'Text': 'This was originally going to be a vent post, but it looked like things have changed. Momentarily. \\nIt\\'s selfish for me to post this, but I want to tell you my story.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe world is boring as hell. There is no stone unturned, neither forest or unseen spots left to be appreciated. The only thing everybody around me, the community I am raised in, values in life is to breed, live, and die. They value family traditions, the sense of importance in a society, money, and \"love.\" Such love is mostly an imprint of their own personal traits onto their children so they die without the regret of contributing nothing significant in their lives. I didn\\'t have much say. They only looked at my needs from a materialistic surface and their own physical gain. And as I grew up, countless senseless social trends rose as a consequence of globalism and the people I used to trust turned into ideological slaves.\\n\\n\"Omg blank pink k pop band lisaa!!\", \"Far right chad far left virgin!?!\", \"Andrew tate top G this,\" \"unspoken rizz that!!!\" “HE IS THE HIGH-VALUE MAN!!” And their definition of love, oh my god, they don\\'t even love it for the sake of loving somebody; they think it is a \\\\\\\\\\\\*responsibility\\\\\\\\\\\\* to get into a relationship at the age of 15.\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m a boomer for my age, like how people of the past seemed to dislike cultures of the present, but the lack of real human communication where things are spoken genuinely and without 50 layers of post-irony for the express purpose of gaining a footing in communities is suffocating.\\n\\nI hated how others lived, and how I did too. I still do, just in a different way.\\n\\nAnd with the realization of this hatred, which became more passive as an acknowledgement of the nature of the world, I fell deep in love with writing. More specifically, stories. Stories that painted a brighter hue to this reality, stories that express genuineness, stories that give meaning to an existentialistic life. And soon, it became apparent that my sole reason for living was for stories. I wanted to understand others\\' stories, mine, and how the ones I\\'ve read emanated warmth. I wanted to make people understand, wholeheartedly and without the constraints of a societal ego, how I really felt. But then I said, \"I\\'m going to write on how people should live!\"\\nIt was a mistake. Motivated by my \\\\\\\\\\\\*own\\\\\\\\\\\\* ego: an intense hatred I experienced everyday at every time and every second, I pushed myself on a long journey. Theorizing and analyzing every nook and cranny there was to the significance of every living being and friend in my vicinity, all their words and the slightest of actions that suggested scrutiny against me; the nature of the human \"ego,\" freewill and utter bullshit. For months on end, I was distrustful of the people I met everyday; how they were flawed, pitiful sinners and how I better not be one. But I was one. This realization drove me deeper into a rabbit hole of truth that I became addicted to, and the changing of my standards every now and then which tried to justify my existence. Sometimes, which became most often times, I convinced myself that masturbating was good and my porn addiction skyrocketed to make me \"motivated.\" I rejected the concept of intimate love, deeming it the weak\\'s unself-reliant way of living. I couldn\\'t distinguish whether it was my ego or my own volition speaking, and I had what felt like nervous breakdowns for an entire week on the very last before the final exams; hypersensitive, blaming others for the fruits of my own actions.\\n\\nAfter all was done, a silence fell on me. I was calm, desensitized.\\n\\nI did not write anything substantial in a year.\\n\\n\\n\\nI only started rebuilding August of last year, from what was left of my writing skills. In fact, I could barely write. And all I got from that journey was some extra, usable writing material.\\n\\nLess than a page a day for a year wasted.\\n\\nMy intrusive thoughts that I gained didn\\'t help: oughting to distract me with the habits of masturbation, lusting over people I personally knew, and the instinctual urge to make myself distinct from others.

Something stirs in its depths.\") and battles with them. Their faces are covered and they drop eye-liked jewels (paranoia reference) which tag might say \"it looks like staring at you\". Also allusion to brain fog.\\n\\n\\\\-The character hallucinates being harassed by spiders (\"They\\'re everywhere! Run!\") which are literally named \"mind spiders\".\\n\\n\\\\-If this warp reaches high amounts, the magic book reveals a new tab with contents like \"Eldritch epiphany\" and \"Eldritch revelation\" where it shows unreadable alien runes (written by the character in a state of advanced amnesic delirium) and quotes like \"I will show them all\" and \"Now I see) \\n\\n\\\\-This eldritch part of the book can make the player travel into an alien maze lost in remote space, filled with brain eating crabs, apparitions, quartz shards, electrifying runes (which add more warp to the character) and a final boss hidden behind a giant gate which opens by using a runic plate on it, maybe as symbolism of ultimate stages of delirium where the victim gets fully lost in their mental world. (Defeating the boss gives the player an item of extreme magical power that upgrades his magical research)\\n\\n\\\\-The weird places where the entrance towards the maze can be opened are often protected by a bunch of hostile knights and clerics that cannot be befriended (symbolism: federals and doctors with evil intentions that only the schizo realizes) and they also have their own ritual book (reference towards theories about satanic sects ruling the world) and they wear red (reference to sacrificial sorcery)\\n\\n\\\\-Warp can be slowly solved with an arcane craft named \"sanity soap\" which probably makes reference to how much victims of schizo states may often forget basic stuff like caring bout personal hygiene due to being hyper focused towards recurrent, obsessive thoughts.\\n\\n\\\\-It is possible to build little (servant) golems out of many materials, one of them being (human) flesh.

I have always had it to an extent that medication doesn’t 100% help me, but like many others, I’ve always been able to academically compensate. My mom didn’t want me labeled growing up, so she never got me accommodations, especially when the meds made it so my grades at least stayed good, even if I was internally struggling to get things done on time. I didn’t even apply for them for the LSAT, however, when I got to law school, everything tanked because obviously your grades are comparative rather than absolute and I was at a disadvantage. So basically, to get accommodations on major tests now is a huge pain in the ass for me. Law school was the first time I got accommodations and it helped a ton. \\n\\nNow, the problem is I am applying for the bar and need to take the MPRE and the bar exam. I am debating not getting accommodations because my diagnosis is from when I was seven so I would either need a new diagnosis and I am currently in Germany until January, or I would need a doctor to review my old medical records. This sounds easy enough but sadly my diagnosing physician retired and before then they changed systems at the office and lost all of my records. I found out when I was going to a new doctor. Luckily, I was able to get them before my old doctor fully retired and sent them to the new doctor to get medication and treatment. Somehow, this new doctor also changed systems and lost all of those records???? So now, I basically have no access to my diagnosing records without an amount of time I just do not have, and I feel like because I’ve always done okay on exams that are absolute (ie, I just need to get a grade and it’s not graded based on a comparison to my peers) I’m debating just not doing accommodations for the MPRE or the bar. Especially considering that it’s pass fail and for more context, I went to a top ten law school and feel like I was very well prepared. So, I’m not too stressed about failing, but I want advice from other attorneys with pretty severe ADHD so I can get a reality check. I really don’t have time to get another diagnosis considering I won’t be back until after the accommodation deadline (I’m stupid for putting it off, I know, but like most others I am incapable of functioning until a deadline is staring me in the face and I’m bordering on a mental breakdown). I know I’d “pass” with flying colors unmedicated lmfao, but it’s a time issue. Am I stupid for not getting accommodations even though I’m 98% sure I’d be fine if I studied (which is an act of god but I did it for the LSAT so let’s hope I can sink 2k into a course so I can force myself to regularly study)?

The Young Man Who Was Afraid  \\n130:6.1  (1437.1) While they were up in the mountains, Jesus had a long talk  with a young man who was fearful and downcast. Failing to derive comfort  and courage from association with his fellows, this youth had sought  the solitude of the hills; he had grown up with a feeling of  helplessness and inferiority. These natural tendencies had been  augmented by numerous difficult circumstances which the lad had  encountered as he grew up, notably, the loss of his father when he was  twelve years of age. As they met, Jesus said: “Greetings, my friend! why  so downcast on such a beautiful day? If something has happened to  distress you, perhaps I can in some manner assist you. At any rate it  affords me real pleasure to proffer my services.”  \\n130:6.2 (1437.2)  The young man was disinclined to talk, and so Jesus made a second  approach to his soul, saying: “I understand you come up in these hills  to get away from folks; so, of course, you do not want to talk with me,  but I would like to know whether you are familiar with these hills; do  you know the direction of the trails? and, perchance, could you inform  me as to the best route to Phenix?” Now this youth was very familiar  with these mountains, and he really became much interested in telling  Jesus the way to Phenix, so much so that he marked out all the trails on  the ground and fully explained every detail. But he was startled and  made curious when Jesus, after saying good-bye and making as if he were  taking leave, suddenly turned to him, saying: “I well know you wish to  be left alone with your disconsolation; but it would be neither kind nor  fair for me to receive such generous help from you as to how best to  find my way to Phenix and then unthinkingly to go away from you without  making the least effort to answer your appealing request for help and  guidance regarding the best route to the goal of destiny which you seek  in your heart while you tarry here on the mountainside. As you so well  know the trails to Phenix, having traversed them many times, so do I  well know the way to the city of your disappointed hopes and thwarted  ambitions. And since you have asked me for help, I will not disappoint  you.” The youth was almost overcome, but he managed to stammer out,  “But—I did not ask you for anything—” And Jesus, laying a gentle hand on  his shoulder, said: “No, son, not with words but with longing looks did  you appeal to my heart. My boy, to one who loves his fellows there is  an eloquent appeal for help in your countenance of discouragement and  despair. Sit down with me while I tell you of the service trails and  happiness highways which lead from the sorrows of self to the joys of  loving activities in the brotherhood of men and in the service of the  God of heaven.”  \\n130:6.3 (1437.3) By this time the young man very much  desired to talk with Jesus, and he knelt at his feet imploring Jesus to  help him, to show him the way of escape from his world of personal  sorrow and defeat. Said Jesus: “My friend, arise! Stand up like a man!  You may be surrounded with small enemies and be retarded by many  obstacles, but the big things and the real things of this world and the  universe are on your side. The sun rises every morning to salute you  just as it does the most powerful and prosperous man on earth. Look—you  have a strong body and powerful muscles—your physical equipment is  better than the average. Of course, it is just about useless while you  sit out here on the mountainside and grieve over your misfortunes, real  and fancied. But you could do great things with your body if you would  hasten off to where great things are waiting to be done. You are trying  to run away from your unhappy self, but it cannot be done. You and your  problems of living are real; you cannot escape them as long as you live.  But look again, your mind is clear and capable. Your strong body has an  intelligent mind to direct it. Set your mind at work to solve its  problems; teach your intellect to work for you; refuse longer to be  dominated by fear like an unthinking animal. Your mind should be your  courageous ally in the solution of your life problems rather than your  being, as you have been, its abject fear-slave and the bond servant of  depression and defeat. But most valuable of all, your potential of real  achievement is the spirit which lives within you, and which will  stimulate and inspire your mind to control itself and activate the body  if you will release it from the fetters of fear and thus enable your  spiritual nature to begin your deliverance from the evils of inaction by  the power-presence of living faith. And then, forthwith, will this  faith vanquish fear of men by the compelling presence of that new and  all-dominating love of your fellows which will so soon fill your soul to  overflowing because of the consciousness which has been born in your  heart that you are a child of God.  \\n130:6.4 (1438.1) “This day, my  son, you are to be reborn, re-established as a man of faith, courage,  and devoted service to man, for God’s sake. And when you become so  readjusted to life within yourself, you become likewise readjusted to  the universe; you have been born again—born of the spirit—and henceforth  will your whole life become one of victorious accomplishment. Trouble  will invigorate you; disappointment will spur you on; difficulties will  challenge you; and obstacles will stimulate you. Arise, young man! Say  farewell to the life of cringing fear and fleeing cowardice. Hasten back  to duty and live your life in the flesh as a son of God, a mortal  dedicated to the ennobling service of man on earth and destined to the  superb and eternal service of God in eternity.”  \\n130:6.5 (1438.2) And  this youth, Fortune, subsequently became the leader of the Christians in  Crete and the close associate of Titus in his labors for the uplift of  the Cretan believers.  \\n130:6.6 (1438.3) The travelers were truly  rested and refreshed when they made ready about noon one day to sail for  Carthage in northern Africa, stopping for two days at Cyrene. It was  here that Jesus and Ganid gave first aid to a lad named Rufus, who had  been injured by the breakdown of a loaded oxcart. They carried him home  to his mother, and his father, Simon, little dreamed that the man whose  cross he subsequently bore by orders of a Roman soldier was the stranger  who once befriended his son.

I think that the mental illnesses and issues of different people interacting with one another has potential to be recipe for disaster and has potential to heighten symptoms in each other.\\n\\nSome of what I\\'m going to state are some feelings I experience but logically, I know are not fair, possibly selfish, and I do everything in my power to not express these feelings towards others. I\\'m curious to know if anyone else feels the same way at times or has gone through similar experience. It makes me feel so guilty, mean, and like a POS at times.\\n\\nI\\'ve lived alone for a while now and at times, with my neurotypical partner who does not experience mental illness who stays over during weekends and some evenings. Sadly, limiting my spaces and interaction with others with similar struggles to me has helped tremendously in me getting healthier.\\nRecently, a family member who also experiences moderate to extreme mental illness ranging from anxiety, depression, and PTSD has been temporarily staying with me. I live with some of these disorders and illnesses and I am also diagnosed with Bipolar II. I\\'m already irritable as it\\'s one of my most reoccurring symptoms and sometimes when I see or experience family members\\' symptoms and moods, I become excessively irritated, annoyed, or cold.

We\\'ve been together for a bit over 3 years and this is my first long term relationship. The first 2.5 years were awesome. We were so happy with each other and everything was okay. But a few months ago, i suddenly got very anxious about the relationship and it hasn\\'t really gone away since then.\\n\\nI have always been an anxious person. I\\'ve been really anxious in this relationship before. But this is wat REALLY worries me: The anxiety I sometimes had in the first 2.5 years, was about the fact that I was scared that he wil someday leave me. This was terrible but I wanted to be with him more than anything else and he gave me joy and happiness whenever I saw him. This anxiety has been gone for a long time, but anxiety came back. But my anxiety now is SUDDENLY about me not being sure if he is the one for me. So it kind of turned around. Nothing happened between us that caused this sudden thought. It just suddenly happened to me.\\n\\nWhat\\'s confusing is that I was always SO sure that we were an awesome fit together and deep down I know this still is true. But I cant stop wondering about everything. \"Are we REALLY a good fit?\" \"Am I still in love?\" \"Why do I feel anxiety about this? This can\\'t be good, right?\" \"Am I just leading him on now?\".\\n\\nHere is the thing: Because I have felt this intense anxiety for a few months now, I have the feeling I don\\'t want to see him again because the idea of seeing him gives me so much anxiety! Because I am too afraid I might get triggered, or get an anxiety peak when he is with me! So my mind screams at me that it\\'s better to withdraw from him and be alone! But  I really think that when i will leave him, this same problem would arise with a potential other partner. And I\\'m scared that I will then realize that I lost someone who was actually a perfect fit for me. Also, we do meet up every week and when we are together the anxiety is rarely as bad as when I\\'m alone, worrying about seeing him. When he is with me tho, I do feel annoyed at him quickly. For no reason. Because the anxiety is still there, even tho it\\'s not as prominent as when I\\'m alone.\\n\\nWe\\'ve talked it through. He knows about my anxiety and he supports me. He does not know that I feel like running away from him tho. I\\'m starting to see a therapist in a few weeks. I think I have an anxious-avoidant attachment style and I also read a lot about ROCD, and it won\\'t surprise me if ROCD is something I have. But then again, I\\'m scared I just make these things up just to have an excuse for not breaking up.\\n\\nSo back to my question: Is it possible that I don\\'t want to see my boyfriend, and withdraw from him, because of this awful anxiety?

People say they have been depressed too because their ex broke up with them or they failed a test but honestly, it’s very different. I tell my friends how hard I’m trying but my anxiety can be very bad sometimes and they just say stop being sad, there are millions of people out there who have no food etc like that is supposed to mean I have no right to feel this way. I can’t just stop…🙄 it’s not a simple switch I can do in my brain that changes how I feel. But I understand why they are that way so I can’t blame them…\\n\\nBefore I had this in 2019, I read about people being depressed and see movies of them cutting, or not eating or having panic attacks and I also thought, “why are they not trying to better themselves? Cutting won’t help. They are doing this on purpose to get attention.” \\nBut when a horrible incident happened in 2019 and spiraled out of control, I was helpless.

It’s not just being nervous or being scared after watching a horror movie and you are scared to go to the bathroom. It’s like your chest starts tightening, your heart goes into overdrive, you scream and cry uncontrollably, you become so lightheaded, your body starts shaking and you feel like burning from the inside and so on. I had my first full blown panic attack and the paramedics didn’t want to take me to the hospital. They came and when my friend explained the situation on the phone to them they said, “Ah so-so. Daijoubo neh? Byouin ikinai. Just relax,” said the older paramedic and left me at home alone because it was “not an emergency and there was no hospital that would take me.” In my mind, I thought I was going to die in this foreign country all alone in this apartment and nobody would know because nobody cared. \\nIt was getting so bad that I remember standing at the top of the roof examining the height and thinking, “Is this high enough to kill me immediately? Hmm… I don’t want to end up paralyzed for life instead.” And at that time that was the only thing stopping me-The building just wasn’t tall enough to kill me…I stood in front of the yellow line so many times hoping to jump when the train comes but thought I didn’t want my family back home to pay for inconveniencing Japanese commuters or having my name plastered across the news and people shaming me for killing myself to the grave. Most of all, I didn’t want God to be disappointed in me. Enough people have left and I couldn’t lose Him too. That was during the height of my anxiety. I didn’t want to die. I had so much to do, to go. But at that moment, the future just looked so bleak,dark and hopeless. When you’re in the void, nothing mattered. It’s like you’re in a trance and you can barely see or hear anybody or anything but your mind…\\n\\nIt gets to a point where you feel nothing but anxiety, of worries, of wanting to hurt yourself to feel something else again.

I lost a lot of friends that time because they thought I changed and was just not cool enough anymore or I was too annoying because I cried a lot.

Basically it says that our vocal cords and even facial muscles are most of the time moving, as if you were talking, but no sound comes out.  Normal people have whatever is required to tune out the “thoughts” you are saying, whereas people with psychosis lack that mechanism, and they start hearing their voice as a foreign sounding thing.  \\n\\nI also found this article: https://slate.com/technology/2016/03/schizophrenia-and-subvocal-speech-why-people-with-schizophrenia-hear-the-voices-of-god-spies-and-supernatural-entities.html\\n\\nAgain, this talks about subvocalization.  And supposedly this doctor placed a small microphone on the throat of a woman with schizophrenia and heard her thoughts/hallucinations through the mic.  \\n\\nI’m just wondering if anyone knows anything else about this.  My old psychiatrist said it was theoretical stuff or whatever, too simple.  But I do notice my vocal cords moving sometimes when I’m having hallucinations.  I don’t subvocalize when I read though, which helps.  \\n\\nI did find this https://www.fastcompany.com/90350006/watch-this-device-translate-silent-thoughts-into-speech\\n\\nWhich apparently is an AI-driven system for literally reading thoughts using various sensors on the throat and face I think.  \\n\\nThe reason I’m asking this is I designed a software app several years ago that was designed to help people with schizophrenia.  But the bottleneck was you had to manually enter your thoughts, which isn’t really practical for a lot of people. I realized if I could solve the reading/capture part, I could make it work and potentially help people.  But I haven’t found any ways to contact any of these people unfortunately.
