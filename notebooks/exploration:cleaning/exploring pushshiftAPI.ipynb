       "  'Text': 'Before you comment \"stop asking reddit for help and seek medical professional help\", understand that I already did, and the solutions they gave me did do something, but not in the most mindfulness/healthy manner. \\n\\nAt the age of 6/7 I was exposed to porn and I feel like that ruined the way I am. My self confidence and behavorial/mental health has been all over the place because of it. As of a couple years ago, I realized that I am actually very attractive to the average person, but I think why I couldn\\'t believe that myself or get 100% into my comfort zone was because i\\'m awkward, with ADHD, and possibly bipolar, which I think mostly stems from the porn exposure. But here I am at 25 with the knowledge that I have now. I feel as if it is too late to be that person I want to be, unless I get help. So here I am. Looking for alternatives.\\n\\nI wont rely mainly on **porn** for my social demise, but I think it plays a big part in a toxic habit I involve myself with. **Voyeurism**. It probably got up to a point where I was tired of regular porn and came across that. That then turned into me actually partaking in voyeurism. Bathrooms mainly of random strangers, but then it was apartments/houses of my past lovers. It is a deep dark secret i\\'ve told absolutely no one until this reddit thread (which is why its a throwaway). \\n\\nI\\'ve been sick with this and I want to stop, but because I have ADHD, I think the impulses from that make me get black and white thinking, then I end up doing whatever I can to release that stress. And the way I release that stress is through masturbation. So that goes hand and hand with voyeurism obviously.  \\n\\nOne of the biggest influences that make me get impulses is stress and anxiety of course. But other things that add onto that is caffeine or amphetamines. I also just think it might be the food that I eat as well, so I am just conscious of what I put into my body. I love **coffee and caffeine**, and wish I can use that boost to keep me up, but it saddens me because all it does is make me dangerously horny up until a point where I have to masturbate or do some voyeurism to release myself. If I do it once for that day then I end up being in a never ending cycle. Its so hard. Now as for **amphetamines**, I have ADHD, so what they prescribe me only makes me 10x worse. Filled with anxiety and horniness that wont go away. That medicine will end up making me masturbate so much throughout the day making me get no work done at all. Its such a sad life I am living because I realized at a late age that I am hard working and super intelligent, but these toxic habits keep me from living my full potential. But this is one part of my demise.\\n\\n**Relationships** on the other hand have been an all around rollarcoaster. Yes I genuinely love deeply and care for my lovers. Current or past. But my impulses and poor control over my mood/feelings leads me to be emotionally abusive. I had went through 3 of my ex\\'s phones, hacked their social medias, snooped through there things, and of course voyeured each one. All because I was insecure and wanted to make sure no one was doing things behind my back, but, I also did it to find out things I shouldnt have known. That was the voyeurism taking in place. I think the overall excitement of doing something you\\'re not supposed to do makes it fun, but in the end i\\'m distraught from my actions. After all of my abusive actions are set and done, the break up comes, and I couldnt handle being alone from them. I end up doing more hacking, cyber stalking, stalking in person, spamming through texts and calls and just keep doing that until that cycle is over. I never truly mean to hurt any of my past lovers. I still think about them and how much they meant to me, but Its SO STRESSFUL to deal with.  Like, I dont have any addicition, but if there was one, its this fucking mental disorder I have and voyeuring. This habit has made me overall depressed and shot my confidence down. \\n\\nAnd it is important to note: (my last two relationships resulted in getting an order of protection against me). \\n\\nI am just not well and need help. Theres so much more I want to say, but for time sake I cant. Is there anyone who is going through something similar and can give me advice? are there better treatment plans instead of dull zoloft or stupid ADHD medication that makes me dangerously horny? Is there a mood stabilizer that will prevent me from making these bad decisions? What can I do to stop this before I get into more trouble.',\n",

My father would storm out of the house for hours, sometimes into the next day. When I was 9 or 10 I started thinking “he’s never coming back” and panicking so I would chase him down the street screaming, sobbing and begging for him to come home. He always eventually did, but the fighting never stopped and so he would always just run out again. My mother was no help, just angry and spiteful (I think she neglected my panic to hurt him more). \\n\\nNow as an adult, I’m married to the most wonderful person I’ve ever met but if we argue and then have to be separated (IE: Work) I can’t stop the same overwhelming panic feeling I had when I was a kid and my dad walked out.

       "  'Text': 'So my Mom is in a depression, she used to work as a teacher but she is on leave now. A few months ago she decided that she just didn’t want to be a teacher anymore, so while still being on health leave, she started working at a local Crafts shop thatcher friend owns. She really liked it and was even going to join in and invest a little money to be co-owner and starting her own branch in the crafts store. Recently it has come to her attention that the owner wants to stop with the arts &amp; crafts store. This has devastated her, it would remain open until September of next year after wich it will stop. She’s now looking at a new job but there isn’t much she actually enjoys doing. \\n\\nThat’s the backstory a little bit, now for what happened today.\\n\\nSo today she returned from work after she got the bad news and was just exhausted. We have a 6 1/2 month old puppy wich she likes to walk with but the puppy can get aggressive sometimes. My sister decided to join my mom in walking the puppy. I was at this point sitting upstairs in my room. I hear they’re back and shortly after I hear my mom screaming downstairs. I got downstairs and I see my sister sitting in the couch not doing a thing while my mom gets attacked by the puppy in her office (my sister clearly hears my mom screaming as she is a couple feet away and I could hear it clearly form upstairs. I take the puppy and put it in its crate and my mom is pretty much having a mental breakdown, crying. This was just the drop that overflowed the bucket. After sitting with my mom for a little bit I learn that my sister is mad at my mom cause my mom promised she’d take my sister to McDonald’s in this week but she told my sister she was probably not going to be able to do that. So my sister just let my mom get attacked cuz she wouldn’t go to McDonald’s with her. (My sister is 13.) what can I do to make my mom feel better? I really blame my sister because it’s almost like she doesn’t care about my moms mental health, she does what she wants, when she wants and does stuff like this when she doesn’t get her way.',\n",

I’m tired of being the silent observer in every situation but it’s the only thing that makes sense to do. I physically cannot speak in social situations. I used to be able to speak my mind with trusted friends (one on one conversations) but lately I can’t even do that. I don’t find joy in anything. I used to draw/paint/write.

I have ptsd, I have GAD and depression and for a while it was managed and I thought I might be okay but I'm never okay and I don't know what to do.

I used to play soccer all the way up until I was 19. I'm 22 now and I can barely walk without my lower back feeling like it's being stabbed. I can't sleep at night, when I finally do fall asleep in the am, I wake up near lunch feeling nauseous and sore. The doctor said my hernia is small and yet I'm having all these issues and pain. I'm not a very sensitive person when it comes to physical pain, so this isn't normal for me. I used to bounce back so easily. I take medication for it and it does nothing, I've changed my diet, nothing. I've lost over 25 lbs in just a month just cause the pain is so bad. I used to take meds for my anxiety and depression but my doctor weaned me off of them cause they made me rlly tired and causes excessive weight gain which he said was bad for my hernia. I've tried other medications and they don't work. I feel hopeless. I'm forgetting who I am. I don't have a job, I don't go to school, I just live with my parents and clean the house all day. Which even tasks like loading the dishes hurt my back and cause me to belch. I also got diagnosed with non alcoholic fatty liver disease because an  abdominal ultrasound showed some texture on my liver. Like wtf is wrong with me? I feel like my abdominal area is just giving up and now on top of mental pain I have constant physical pain. I don't even take care of myself anymore. I have no energy. It makes me want to give up. I'm so alone and I can't seem to find hope anymore. No one here listens to me. My mom gets mad when I talk about my pain. I live in a smaller city where it's hard to get good Healthcare. I don't have the money to get actually good Healthcare. I feel like I'm dying.\",\n",

       "  'Text': 'Over the past days I received a lot of comments and advice regarding my  posts here on reddit about my experience with my doctor - thank you  kindly to everyone who took the time to share their thoughts. (The  doctor had carressed my face during a check up and said \"cute, little  thing\" while doing so and I was trying to find out if he behaved  inappropriately.) While reading through and engaging with comments and  thinking about my time as a patient with him, more and more details and  memories started popping up suddenly and today, everytime I thought  about certain moments, I could feel myself starting to panic and it was  difficult to calm down. There´s a memory in particular that just  resurfaced today that bothers and stresses me out immensely and I am not  sure what to do with it. Most of it is quite blurry and fuzzy but I  think I am starting to make more sense of the little scenes that keep  popping up. Which is scary. The memory is from a few years ago when I  had a 6 hour surgery and was in my doctor´s care right after. The thing I  remember happened a little while after waking up from anesthesia I  think. Probably a couple hours later but I was still completely out of  it and groggy and just able to lay in bed if I remember correctly. At  that point my doctor came in to check on me. He and I were alone in that  room. I remember that we were laughing about a silly joke that I think I  made, and then that harmless banter escalated in to something super  weird and strange. I think I was in pain and hyperventilating or  something like that and he pulled some pills out of his pocket and gave  me one of them. I think he took one as well but I am not sure about  that. It´s hard to remember. After that, there´s really strange snippets  of him, sitting on the side of the bed and holding me, my head resting  on his shoulder, crying desperately. Then him, doing... something...  that I can´t quite recall or pinpoint but I feel like it was quite  physical and there was a lot of movement and commotion and everytime my  thoughts try to go there and figure it out, I start to feel like  blacking out and panicking again. Heavy chest, hard to breathe type of  feeling. I hear his voice clearly, saying over and over again \"it´s  okay, hey, hey, it´s going to be okay. Don´t cry, it´s okay, it´s okay.  I´m here, it´s okay.\" And I think I was asking him a lot of questions  but couldn´t get him to respond. It´s this horrible feeling of being  trapped, almost like sleep paralysis. Today is the first time I ever  remembered or thought of this stuff. I threw up because of it and  couldn´t focus on work all day and just feel like hiding in a room, not  talking to anyone in person. I´m not quite sure what´s going on with me  and I don´t know if this is something like PTSD or not but could someone  please give me some advice on what to do or what this even means? This  is overwhelming. I impulsively wanted to try to call my doctor and hoped  he´d be able to help me understand what my memory is about but then I  realized it probably would be a stupid idea and thankfully renounced.  But for some reason I feel the urge to talk to him, while I feel scared  at the same time. I have an appointment with him soon, so that´s  stressing me out as well. I will probably have to cancel that. Although I  just want answers to be honest and to talk this through with him. This  can´t just be in my head.',\n",

It’s important to mention that I’m an introvert and I don’t really love going out with people. It was also a rainy day, so I had plans to wake up early and watch movies / play games all day long. I wanted to relax. Well, I did not. I woke up at 9 instead of 6 because I felt exhausted. I watched some videos before I realized it was already 11. I then decided to change my sheets, clean up my room and the bathroom, because living in a dirty environment makes me stressed. I did all that, shaved, took a shower. I finished at 2:30. I then had lunch, checked emails, watched some videos and tried to reorganize my playlists.

I have been asking, BEGGING for weeks at this point and NO ONE will help. My psych quit and left me high and dry, but everywhere I call has no appointments for WEEKS and some are booking for next March and April. \\n\\nDue to the gov cracking down on controlled substance prescriptions (or perhaps another reason 🤷🏾\\u200d♀️), I can’t find a single PCP willing to help me manage my medication- even as a bridge until I can be seen by a psych.  They told me to go to the ER and they’d be able to help. In desperation I called the ER to ask. Of course they told me that is not how anything works. In what universe is it a good idea for a black woman to go to the ER asking for controlled substances citing mental health issues? In what universe is the ER the place you send anyone to for a non critical emergency?!?\\n\\nI found Circle Health and heard great things about them. Per their own site they treat my conditions and prescribe my medications. I thought this would kill two birds with one stone. I could get my refills and get help with my situational anxiety.\\n\\nHowever, I was told I could get no help from them due to my insomnia medication I get filled 3x a year maybe. Because I just filled it on October 6, they wouldn’t prescribe the medications that I take daily or help with the crippling anxiety that is about to further ruin my life. \\n\\nI was not asking for that refill. It is honestly the last thing from my mind and I begged for help. I don’t even have any refills remaining but was told they wouldn’t even consider it until Dec 6 because “that would prove I’m not a regular user”. However my account would still be flagged.\\n\\nPray tell what that has to do with anything? I could not take a single one until that date. I could take all of them a couple weeks before the appointment, one every night and twice on Sunday. I could use them sparingly in general which is what I do. In any case they wouldn’t know how I’m using it. Just when I last filled it. I’m not a medical professional but I fail to see how that matters at all except to shield them from lawsuits and keep their insurance low. \\n\\nI’ve been dealing with these issues for over a decade and anyone who cares enough to go through my records would realize I’m not just rolling in off the street begging for drugs to get high. If that’s all I wanted, I could go down to the boulevard and self medicate with no suspicion or questions asked. \\n\\nWithout my medications I am physically and mentally unable to be a productive member of society. I become a burden on my family and friends. But the profession that claims to “First do no harm” has literally told me my options are: go to the ER, wait weeks to be seen by a psych, or have a breakdown and be hospitalized. And I don’t know what to do except wait for the day I wake up and realize I don’t have the strength to fight anymore.\\n\\nThen what? I am in the process of restarting therapy but that is not an instant panacea. My brain is unbalanced so I could talk til the universe implodes and I would still need my meds to remain stable.

       "  'Text': '**1. Depression**\\n\\nAt this age, you may have more financial obligations than you did in your twenties or thirties. Your body will begin to change and show aging. You may be responsible for taking care of one or both of your parents. If you compare yourself with others, you are more likely to be depressed. According to a study conducted by the CDC depression is more prevalent among women and people aged 40 to 59. Depression can affect your concentration or ability to communicate with others and thus your physical health, so when you feel depressed, contact a therapist. There are many medical websites on the Internet, such as [sehasky](https://www.sehasky.com/), that provide reliable medical and psychological advice and may recommend some medications that may benefit you.\\n\\n**2. obesity**\\n\\nIn the 40s there are changes in hormone levels that affect weight and the ability to burn fat and build muscle, as well as metabolism (how the body burns calories). It is difficult to lose weight with age, especially if you are a woman over forty. Premenopausal hormones reduce weight loss, but not hormones alone. Weight gain is related to age, genetics and lifestyle\\n\\n3. **Breast cancer**\\n\\nBreast cancer is a concern for women over the age of 40, with one in 8 women in the United States developing breast cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, the risk of developing breast cancer for men is about 1 in 833, yet 500 men die of this disease each year. Early detection and proper treatment can prevent this disease from spreading throughout the body and causing further damage.\\n\\nTo learn more, you can read this article.\\n\\n[https://medium.com/@rashaeid1805/the-most-common-health-problems-in-the-forty-80e061497b32](https://medium.com/@rashaeid1805/the-most-common-health-problems-in-the-forty-80e061497b32)',\n",

I wanna give up. I never thought about suicide. And I know I’ll never go there. But I just feel like every single time it just gets worse and worse and I have no one to speak to about it. I can’t tell someone in my family I feel like one by one everyone would find out. It’s like I have to push through it alone but why. Why can’t I just be a teen who enjoys college?

I wish I had someone who would be here with me now. I’m starting to not go to some of my classes and I use a bullshit excuse “attendance isn’t mandatory”. I wanna drop out.

I’m feeling very lost in my thoughts today so wanted to hear your points of you. \\nA bit of background: I love my job (event planning) but I tend to get very involved in it and have a hard time finding a good work/life balance. I had a burnout 3 years ago at my previous job. \\n\\nI’ve been at this job for 2.5 years now. I love it. But we’re a very small non-profit, I’m the only employee (+ I’m bad at setting good boundaries) so my work duties have extended well beyond what they were originally. Our very busy season is March till the end of September. \\n\\nThe first year went well as most events were canceled due to covid. \\nLast year, it was tough. Being the only employee, I worked crazy hours. My volunteer team was supportive but can’t help me more. \\nTo help me during the 2022 season, we decided to hire an intern. He was okay, a little green but helped me during the first 3 months of the season. The season was still tough as we always have new things coming up. I ended up on muscle relaxers and anxiety meds for the last 3 weeks of the season. \\nI know October is always rough as I’m recovering from a few complicated months but this year it’s different. I don’t seem to recover. Everything is a struggle. Replying to a simple email sucks all the energy out of me. \\nI tried to take it slow but it doesn’t seem to get better. I took a few days off but I feel like it doesn’t help. \\nI think it’s because I’m afraid of facing a new season of events next year. \\nI don’t know what to do. I talked to my boss two weeks ago, he’s aware of the issue and is going to try to get funding to hire an entry-level employee to help me during next season but not very hopeful about it. The company doesn’t have enough money to hire a second \"me\". And I usually love my job, love the team but I’m struggling and don’t know what to do… I don’t want to quit and leave them struggling but I also know I can’t face another season alone. Should I ask my boss for another meeting and be very clear that I’m struggling?\\nThanks for sharing your POV',\n",

       "  'Text': \"WARNING: VERY, VERY LONG READ.\\n\\nBackstory: My wife and I have been together for 14 years. We lived in together in Seattle. She is from New York and I'm from Seattle. In 2020, her father was getting up there in age and his health was declining so she made the decision to go back to New York to help take care of him. I wasn't happy about that. I gave her a hard time leading up to the move and during it. When we arrived to New York, I was much worse and distanced myself from her. She didn't like that. I didn't want to be there so much that when I'm going back to Seattle every 3-4 months and spending 4-5 weeks there at a time. She didn't like that either. When I am in Seattle, I am typically every busy. My day consists of waking up &gt; go to work &gt; go to the gym after work &gt; go home &gt; shower &gt; eat dinner &gt; go to bed. By the time I am settling in and getting ready for bed, it is around 9 PM. With a 3 hour time difference, that would make it midnight out there and barely give me any time to talk to my wife at all. Again, she didn't like that. One day, she sat me down and told me that she wanted to separate. When I asked why, she cited the reasons I just listed. At this point, I am devastated. I realized that my selfish actions led to me losing the most important thing in my life (my marriage) and the guilt of that is eating me up inside. Here is where the abuse starts.\\n\\nWe went to Seattle together in August. One day she told me that her friend is pregnant and she's staying over there to help take care of her. 3-4 days comes around and I am wondering where she is and texting her, calling her, begging her to come home. A few days later, she finally comes home and I was so overwhelmed that I hugged her and cried. We go to California together and spend about a week there and come back to Seattle. She says she needs to take care of her friend again and leaves for another week. One night, I was in the living room watching TV and she was sleeping in the bedroom. I got thirsty and didn't feel like going to the kitchen to get something to drink (the bedroom is closer to me than the kitchen) and my wife always has a bottle of water on the nightstand next to her so I go over there instead. There her phone was out in the open and I see the messages between her and another guy. I find out where she really was while she was gone. When I confront her about it, she told me that the attention that I wasn't giving to her, this guy happened to come along and was able to give it to her. It hurts not only knowing where she had been all this time, but she saw my emotions when she was gone and when she came back, but still chose to leave again.\\n\\nOne night we were having dinner, and I was talking to her trying to convince her not to separate. This was before I found out that she was cheating. Keep in mind that I was consumed by the guilt of what I did. She said that she was not changing her mind and kept telling me everything I did that lead to this. Throughout dinner, she kept telling me that I destroyed my marriage and it was my selfish actions that caused everything to fall apart and she hopes that I learned from this. Remember that I was already upset as is, but everything she said just made it worse. I completely lost my appetite and couldn't even finish my dinner.\\n\\nSoon after, I move out of New York and back to Seattle. Even though we're separated we agreed to end on good terms and hope to remain friends. Our anniversary is coming up and we talked about maybe flying her out to Seattle to do something nice. She says that while she is out there, she might as well go see the other guy too. I asked her if she is serious and she responded that it would be a wasted trip if she flies all the way out to Seattle without seeing him. Obviously, I am completely offended by what she said. I told her don't bother and when she asked why, that offended me even more. I couldn't believe that she doesn't see why that would be considered disrespectful and I had to explain that to her. Obviously, she gets mad and we take a break from speaking. A few days later we talk again and we eventually agreed that I go to New York to celebrate our anniversary. I go in there and I notice that all of the pictures that has me in it are taken down. Instead, they are replaced with pictures of her new guy and they are EVERYWHERE.\\n\\nWhen we were in California, we were in the car and I told her to put on whatever music she wants on. All of a sudden she puts on these random love songs and she normally doesn't listen to them. I commented that she normally doesn't listen to this type of music and she says that she feels like listening to it now. This was the same music that she listened to when she picked me up at the airport in New York and this is the same music that she listened to when she took me to the airport. Come to find out that this was a playlist that her new guy had made for her. When I told her that this isn't okay, she said that these are just songs that she likes and it's not a big deal. I responded that no, they're not just songs. They are songs that obviously remind her of him and I'm disgusted that she not only has been playing them while she took me to and from the airport, she played them when we were in on vacation together in New York. I eventually made her shut it off but she gave me a hard time about it.\\n\\nIt was about an hour long ride to the airport so we had a lot of time to talk and discuss things. She admitted that when we were in Seattle together that curiosity got the best of her and she just had to see what happened if she met the other guy. She said that during the time they spent together, he treated her so well that she finally felt what it was like to be happy. She commented that she looks forward to finally being happy because of the way that this new guy will continue to treat her. At this point, I feel like I am being belittled. She is rubbing him in my face and it is making me feel insignificant. It makes me feel like I wasn't able to support her. It makes me feel like I'm nothing.\\n\\nI have been talking to her older brother and sister throughout this whole ordeal. I don't know where I would be without them, but they have been there for me and supported me at my lowest point. I found out from her sister that she was planning on coming to Seattle in December and probably wasn't planning on telling me or seeing me. When we lived in New York together, she came with me maybe every 8-9 months or more. She was just here in August and all of a sudden she wants to come 4 months later? Also, when we were planning her coming to Seattle for our anniversary, her plan was coming to Seattle for a week. Our anniversary is on a weekend, so she was planning on getting that out of the way and spending the rest of the week with the other guy. At this point, it is very evident where her priorities are. Even though we are not together, we have also been married for 14 years. This guy doesn't have nearly the history that her and I have and it hurts watching me being pushed to the wayside for somebody that she's only known for a little over a year. I would also think that if she wanted to continue to remain friends, she'd at least want to see me.\\n\\nAs this point, I don't think I can do it anymore. Even though we initially agreed to remain friends throughout this whole thing, she isn't even treating me like one. She is finding all of the parts that are emotionally and psychologically sensitive and just poking at it. It is almost like she is finding some sort of sick joy in doing this to me. I may not have treated her the best for the past few years but everything I described above was just in the past two months alone and in my opinion, completely overshadow everything that I have done to her. She told me that she loves me and she will always love me but this behavior isn't love, it's evil. It's gotten to the point where I have already made an appointment to seek a therapist and find professional help. I don't even want to be in Seattle any longer. Everything here reminds me of everything that happened. My wife, her cheating on me, her coming here and not even bothering to care to see me. As much as I would like to keep her in my life, I believe that it may be best for my own sake to cut her off. I hate that I am letting her consume me as much as she has but I still really care about her and I always will. I just can't believe that somebody that supposedly cares about me is treating me like this.\\n\\nThank you so much for reading through all of this and I just want to know your thoughts here.\",\n",

When socializing with my friends, they often laugh and I don't understand why. I assume they are joking and it just goes over my head. I often feel confused, in general. I am a bit naive and I feel easily manipulated. It is difficult for me to understand when people are lying to me. I am forgetful and very disorganized. I have a very hard time understanding people and their intentions.\\n\\nDespite all this, I managed to maintain a decent grade average (top 10-15% of my class). For most of my studies I have managed to work as a TA and I have completed an additional math component (the whole degree is worth 180 credits, and this course was worth 30 credits). I also managed to somehow obtain a job at the University as a research assistant where i work as a full stack web dev. I usually skip lectures and learn mostly from the textbooks. In an attempt to boost my low  self esteem I have also done multiple online Mensa tests where I have obtained scores from 126 to 133 (I know they do not offer an accurate estimate of intelligence). I have never failed an exam or an assignment. As a child, I learned to read just as I became 4 years old by myself.\\n\\nThis might sound like a humble brag, but it is not. I feel like I don't understand the material I have learned to a very deep level. In my jobs I feel like I am mediocre. I don't know how, but I keep getting in those positions, that I do not deserve. I don't feel like I will have a good career. I feel like I have made a horrible mistake. I wish to go away to a place far away from this world. I have no work ethic, I feel like I am not good enough. I always procrastinate and do work in the last moment. I feel so inadequate I wish I would die sometimes.\\n\\nThere are just to many variables in this world my mind cannot comprehend. I feel like if I were more intelligent, I could solve most of my problems. Unfortunately, the current scientific consensus is that such a thing is impossible.\\n\\nI feel hopeless and weak. Does anyone relate? Is there anything I can do?\\n\\nTLDR: I feel stupid,naive and confused , despite having accomplished certain things that show the opposite. Has anyone else been there?\",\n",

She's struggling with business and my brother who has severe ADHD and it's getting so extreme she breaks down several times a day. I believe she is severely depressed and ridden with anxiety and she says she knows this. The problem is she is in that state where NOTHING seems possible. Where there is no hope and no positivity anywhere, ever. She just said her life is horrible - this woman has gone through an abusive marriage, had to leave to work in another country in order to feed me when I was 8, worked so hard her feet were bruised blue, and now she has a beautiful house in the Alps, a husband who supports and loves her, her own business that blossoms, etc. That's how extremely depressed she is - finally her life is what I always hoped it would be and yet she spiraled down into working so hard she's afraid to open her emails, and my brother's stimming makes her cry.\\n\\nI myself went through two decades of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, eating disorders, anger management issues, etc etc. I'm still not great, but I'm much better, and that's thanks to antidepressants. I would really love to go to therapy, but at the moment that's not possible. But the fact that just antidepressants helped me so much is giving me hope that they could help my mum as well. I know that's not a given, but it's a start. I know that once my depression subsided, my whole life opened up. Everything got easier. I tried to tell her this but she is absolutely closed off to all of it. Every single argument I make, she has a reason not to even consider it - she says she has no time. That's because she's a workaholic and doesn't prioritize her own health or life. She refuses to even call her GP to ask if he could potentially prescribe them for her. I said he should be able to since he prescribed them to me, but he did that because I already had papers from a GP in the UK (she lives in Austria) so she's sure he wouldn't do it for her and anyway she hasn't been to him in four years. I asked if I could ask him myself and she said that would be extremely embarrassing for her. I am THIS close to giving her my meds and going without. \\n\\nToday I lost it and we just screamed at each other. I pretty much colossally fucked up. I just can't see a way to get through to her.

Please help if you can I'd appreciate it.  \\n[https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Of8eLwcKe](https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Of8eLwcKe)  \\nThank you\",\n",

       "  'Text': 'Im currently on 37.5mg of venlafaxine but I take a quarter of a tablet a night so about 9 mg so not a therapeutic dose. I’m looking to switch to 25mg sertraline and plan to do this in a coue of weeks but wondered if I should start taking the 9mg every other day to wean off even more (I’ve been on 9 mg for about a year lol). However I don’t know if it’s psychosomatic but I do get some withdrawals when I miss a dose mainly brain zaps but a mental health nurse said I shouldn’t get any because it’s such a low dose. So would it be better to wean off a bit more before I start sertraline or just go to sertraline? Would this decrease the chance of severe side effects if I do more weaning now then straight switching?',\n",

My codependant depression was too much, and she felt like she could never have bad days or come to me for support beacuse she was always supporting me.

She seems totally fine and just wants to be normal friends who do normal things. I'm sobbing on the shower floor, because I feel like I ruined the best opportunity of my life, every night. She's living her best life, becoming friends with her exes again, acting totally put together. I asked her best friend (my adopted, somewhat distant sister) if she seems okay and it seems she is totally fine.\\n\\nDid I fuck up so bad that shes happy to have left me?\\nHow the fuck do I start living for myself? \\nAll I want is her attention and love.

Sometimes it’s a worry about something that will happen in my present or future. Maybe it is sometimes triggered by multiple bad things that were similar in nature that have happened in the past that I get reminded about from something that triggered it, and I get worried I will happen again, but that’s not always the case, sometimes it is something I am worried about that hasn’t happened before. \\n\\nWhat’s weird is that it feels like dissociation, but it’s negative thoughts, rather than positive ones. I get spaced out, and don’t realize what is happening around me in real life. Something from the outside environment either interrupts it, or it has to play out until the thought ends. \\n\\nCan PTSD cause you to worry about things that could happen and get you into episodes like these? \\n\\nI’m frustrated that I don’t have a name for what I go through. \\n\\nI have past traumas, but it’s probably CPTSD, rather than PTSD. These traumas were repeated things in my childhood growing up most often. \\n\\nI still have triggered flashbacks from past traumas, but I’m not sure what future anxious thoughts causing me episodes like flashbacks are called.

I never had many friends. Or good ones so to speak really in my life. \\nIn 2017. I’m 17 I met this girl so to speak let’s say Tara 23. I was friends for about a year and dated when I was 18 split when I was 20. Yes she was my only friend. Best mate hence why I fell for it. Absolutely loved her to bits. \\nBig mistake I been laughed about it a few times. Which just sucks. \\n\\nWe dated until 2020 October. We were distanced relationship 2 hours away from each other. The reason for this split was the pandemic. In short terms. Her exact reason. We didn’t see each other much. WHICH REALLY REALLY UPSET SO MUCH. I was Confused my head was spinning. \\nI was stupid upset. sent messages, emails, created accounts Facebook. you name it I probably did it after the breakup. I don’t agree with this behaviour. I was so heartbroken. I truly lost who I used to be as a person. So upset guilty. Hating myself. \\n3 suicide attempts in 2021 usually through gas carbon monoxide. I remember a letter I sent to her. Called the police and today honestly I’m grateful. I was on Medication then which honestly I stopped taking as it caused schizophrenia made me push her away to the point we didn’t talk because these pills made me worse. We didn’t speak for about a month in advance at this point. But made it worse due to medication and my mental health. \\n\\nI finally went to do therapy twice. I try to elaborate as much detail as I can. There’s a lot. \\nAbout how I was depressed. \\nHow I should have spoke about how I struggled during the pandemic missing her. How I miss the family I could of had with her. I was going to be a dad at one point. But agreed abortion would be best until we live together to finically support the child. \\nHow I followed the rules. \\nSacrifice my mental health and feelings. \\nI didn’t say how much I missed her.  \\nHearing Boris have a party. \\nI got so angry all the time. I have autism which I thought played it part in my communications\\nI started to hate myself because I was autistic. This all create trauma relapse memories of that year in my head constantly. Even in dreams. \\n\\nI have box of our memories we had. I kept stuff like Chvrches tickets. Or a shirt she brought me. I blame myself everyday that’s she’s out of my life. I really loved this person. And this has seriously caused me what I believe to be PTSD. Or very similar symptoms of it due guilt etc. she didn’t want to lose me as a mate. But I made everything worse. I can only compare this behaviour as if she’s dead. having a breakdown every few months. I wouldn’t say it’s obsession because I don’t stalk her. Or go down to hers. Or parents house. None of that odd stuff. I feel I was too close. Dependent on her. Because she was my best mates \\nI care about his person hence why I feel awful all the time. \\n\\nMy instinct is fix it fix it fix it. Sent letters send this. \\n\\nBut I know I shouldn’t feeling this way now. It’s ok to care about someone. Love someone. I just feel like my case is more complex due to reasons &amp; timing. \\nI try to find ways to cope but pandemic seems rare. Studies show a lot of people broke up because of this. So I’m sure I’m not alone here \\n\\nFrom selfish point of view I would love to date her again. But mental health wise I know I’m not 100% more like 70%. \\n\\nI guess the advice I’m asking is. How do I move forward losing a relationship with your best friend(only). From pandemic. I had a really good relationship with her. Like amazing. I don’t expect it will be fixed anytime soon. But anything to help me cope even the next year or 2 would be great to help me on the right track\\n\\nThanks to whoever read this.',\n",

I lost my battle against OCD, didn’t get the job, lost my girlfriend, never bought the kava bar (my family was going to buy it to keep it open as the property was being sold), lost the 200 friends I had there as it got shut down, lost my identity, oersonality, sense of self, ability to feel positive emotion, and entered a never ending state of extreme dysphoria that cannot be fixed because it’s tied to my OCD routine which stopped working, which is also unrecorded. I became unable to feel positive emotion, and begun screaming, bawling, puking, and losing my ability to care for myself.\\n\\nI am currently facing permanent isolation in a shitty apartment with an inability to enjoy anything, drinking protein shakes and continuing to rot, alone, after a 6 year journey I already suffered through that I can’t believe in just skating over because even prior to this I had already dealt with a. Lifetime of distress and couldve ivercome it and the. Had happy days from then on and been touring the world playing DJ shows, speaking I the psych field, writi g psych literature, training again, and OCD free with her by my side.\\n\\nI have every reason to kill myself, but I also have an existential fear of death and am terrified of it and cannot accept that it’s going to happen someday.\\n\\nThe agony I am in is intolerable. Nothing relieves it. No experience, distraction, outlet, person, drug or stimulation. Nothing.\\n\\nI lay in bed morbidly fucked, panicking about how things would’ve been, writing notes in my phone about the person I used to be as I watch him fade and how things would’ve been, unable to tell whether the borderline catatonia or the panic is worse. I believe if it weren’t for the extreme distress and panic I would be fully catatonic. Instead I just can’t shower or eat or take care of myself.\\n\\n7 years ago I had dreams of changing the world.\\n\\nFor 6 years I put in the work to get there, while everyone else was in college, joining grates, graduating, going to grad school, I humbly attended treatment, learned, grew, entertained, helped others and made music.\\n\\n18 months ago I was ready to change the world. Every ritual I ever did, every trigger I suffered though, the bouts of OCD spending 10 hours a day to get out of bed, the years of manifestation and joke and belief, and I was right there. I did the Kat ritual I would’ve ever had to do and would’ve beaten this and been the happiest man I. The world and chased my dreams as my real self til my dying day. \\n\\nNow I’m already dead. I don’t know what the fuck to do, and neither does anyone else.\\n\\nI could’ve told my story on the big screen, and instead it’s on a shitty reductionist Reddit post that appreciates none of the incredible details or adventures, my triumphs and downfalls, nothing.

(im 18, i stll live wth my mom, but i am going to move out asap.) i felt this bad because i didnt have any friends or any partner, or anybody but my mom who took any ind of interest in me, and id felt like this for a while even before my mom had met her bf, and this was frustrating her then. people have always called me spoiled, maybe i am. i dont really put any value on material thngs m aware i am blessed but dont feel liike i deserve anything because i am a dickhead. i just feel like the worst person. god i dont even want to finish typing this.\\n\\nme and my mom have had a fucking ntense relationshp, to the point of where we spent everyday together from me being 13 onwards cause ive never had friends. i had to rapidly adjust to her being out everyday wth her boyfriend. in total ive probably spent like 1 1/2 weeks alone with her since june. i love her and her boyfriend together, shes rediscovered her feminine side, she dresses up more and feels pretty. i want her to be fucking happy.. do you now what. ive made her feel like shit, when i say anything nice, its probably best to not fucking believe me because im a cunt that wastes and abuses everyone\\n\\nwhat was the point. i cant finisg this because im literally agruing with her right now. we arent seeing eye to eye. i think ive become quite needy since i was used to being around her everyday. she says shes fucking confused as to why, but shes not dumb. you fucking raised me, yet you cant see any mistakes that youve made? i know ive been shit to her recently, ive been shit towards myself and everybody. i feel overcome with depression and its making me a really angry, confused, jealous and lonely person. that was never me. i cant even listen to my favourite songs wthout feeling jealous. if m gonna be completly honest m sick of the fucking world. anything i suggest to her that im not happy with she isnt taking any responsibility for, she has made some effort but the rest of the blame goes on me. im sick of seeing my mom and her boyfriend. m sick of seeing them drink every fucking nght and iim sick of the paranoid idiots arguing about cheatiing once theyve had a disagreement.  \\ni feel numb i feel dead. in an deal world id like to change thngs but now dont think our worlds fucking worth it. she cant seem to accept the fact that iim depressed. i dont do it for attention, I WOULDNT MIND HER THINKING THAT IF I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I WAS WORTH ANYBODYS FUCKING TIME!  \\npeople dont talk about anything that matter, theyed rather talk about sex, drugs, stupid shit on tv, politics and parties all the time. or they reminisce about being young and stupid. i dont wanna hear it anymore. everybody is fucking boring. i have dreams yes, but i dont even know if theyre worth staying alive for. i dont know wanna kill myslef but it feels like my only option. ive mentioned this to her, but my mom has had a rough life experience, she doesnt talk about it much, but she throws her upbringing in my face whenever i feel like shit. i compare myself enough as it is. if you wanted me to turn out like you maybe you should have fucking beat me.\\n\\ni dont know what to do. i seriously dont. i really wanna move out. i just wanna leave the world because nearly every person i come across just bores me. probably because im a fucking princess and think im the best.  \\nif any living thing has gotten to the end of this shit without laughing. thanks.',\n",

I’ve had 7 jobs this year alone. I’ve essentially be doing worthless jobs my entire working career. Delivery driving, selling tickets at water parks, etc. \\n\\nI had my first, what I would call, real job back in June working at a travel agency. It was a call center job and during training there was just so much information that my brain started getting overloaded, then I started panicking because I felt I was falling behind (this has always been an insecurity of mine feeling like I haven’t experienced as much or know as much as I should have at my age). Being that it was a call center job and at heart a sales job it was just too much pressure for me. The only times I felt okay were when I took some Xanax but I ran out of xans I got from a friend and I also don’t want a benzo addiction. It made me realize tho that I did know what I was doing. Benzos can cause memory loss but in my case I started remembering things because I can think clearly when I’m not anxious.\\n\\nI’m not incompetent, but I make a lot of mistakes when I’m anxious. It ended up being too much for me, I asked a customer if I could call them back and then quit to my manager and left. I felt so defeated and it ruined my confidence because I felt like I couldn’t handle a “real job”. I ended up going back to delivering pizza but I just couldn’t stay down. I hated the idea of being stuck in that position. Now I have another real job and it’s my first few days of training. I worry because it’s also a lot of information thankfully I don’t really have to deal with customers in the same way as my job in June and leadership isn’t a bunch of assholes that don’t explain anything and expect you to just get it. \\n\\nI need to get my anxiety and lack of confidence under control. I know I’m highly capable when I’m in the right mind but it’s really hard to do my best when I feel anxious. My anxiety gets so bad that I can’t even speak in full sentences sometimes, sometimes I’ll develop a stutter too',\n",

Our relationship was a little toxic, very codependent. \\nAmongst other things, I\\'ve delved into some very repressed S.A. from my childhood, I\\'m questioning my sexuality (in theory, because my relationship is strictly monogamous) and I\\'m also starting to feel like I don\\'t really \"feel\" the whole monogamy thing anymore. We\\'ve talked extensively about my feelings about being with someone of my gender, about how I want to be able to explore my sexuality and have it be purely about me, seeing as I equate my sexual being as something my partner owns, has always owned, and not in an abusive way, just in a pretty toxic way that just developed. My partner is very uncomfortable with the idea, but is trying to be open, to learn about it and to come to a place where I can explore it without causing resentment. Because my partner understands I have a lot of residual resentment over some shit from our past. We came to a place where my partner has expressed the boundaries they\\'re comfortable with, and although I crave more, I love and respect my relationship and won\\'t push that.\\n\\nAnyway, 8 years ago, I had zero friends. Only my partner, who actively avoided friends. I felt lonely though. All the time. Hollow, and, honestly, suicidal, often, at least passively.\\n\\nFast forward and I have made myself lots of friends. Really close friendships, very surface ones, all kinds. I have found love in a way I didn\\'t know existed, and I began to love myself. I started antidepressants, I got a degree, I lost 50kg. \\n\\nHere\\'s my problem. I\\'m so confused about my sexuality that I am putting out vibes, like I\\'m interested (which I am) and available (which I\\'m not). And I\\'ve fucked up 3 great friendships now because 1) I don\\'t know how to deal with someone telling me they want a sexual relationship with with me, like, I actually just blush and laugh and change the subject. 2) I have been really attracted to them, and my mind dwells on things I\\'d like to do, which obviously comes across, and on one occasion, I tried being honest and saying the vibes are real, but nothing can happen and I think it just makes my friend try harder. 3) after a lot of conversations, I had told my friend about the boundaries within my relationship, and was clear on what I \"could offer\"(I.e. nothing sexual and nothing ongoing, just a little \"fun\"). And I thought we were on the same page, I thought I was clear, but then I think my friend wanted more or thought that they were causing me to cheat, or thought that they would come between me and my partner and now my friend is ghosting me (months now).\\n\\nAnyway. I\\'ve been having some pretty dark thoughts again and last night I just really wanted to talk to a particular friend, and the fact that we cant be friends anymore kind of triggered intrusive thoughts again.',\n",

       "  'Text': 'Okay, for context, me (17f) and my best friend (17f) have been friends since the beginning of middle school. When we met we always butted heads and argued about little things kids fight about, but we were attached at the hip. Our moms raised us through MS and HS together, and often disciplined us together etc. since we usually got in trouble together. Anyways, I have had a long string of terrible friendships, my first best friend sexually abused me for five years when I was 7 all the way to 12 yrs old. After that I became best friends with another girl at our school, but she was murdered in may of 2018 the summer before seventh grade. After that my current best friend and I met and we’ve been bffs ever since. I’ve had a really hard time coping with my past trauma, I developed an eating disorder for the majority of middle and high school, as well as cut myself frequently. I’ve always wished I could just die but I was scared of killing myself because my family and friends would be devastated and I can’t make myself do that to them. My best friend has a rough family life, her dad is a recovered abusive alcoholic, her older brother went down a similar path and attempted suicide last year, so she’s got her own problems. Last year she started dating this guy I heavily disapproved of and we fought about it a lot, she gave him her virginity and then he became an abusive asshole and they just recently broke up. During the time they were together she kind of shut me out and got in with the wrong crowd, she was sneaking out of her second story window using sheets she’d tied together and eventually even broke both of her arms falling out of it and had to have surgery because she didn’t listen to me. Fast forward to now, I thought we were doing okay and things could go back to normal, but her dad texted last night saying she overdosed on Tylenol and was in the hospital. I feel like the worst person ever because instead of crying or feeling bad I felt angry and envious of her. I didn’t understand how she could do this to everyone who loves her when she is the main reason for all of her problems. I feel betrayed and hurt and I know I’m making this about me when I shouldn’t be but I’m so tired of her not listening to me and having to hear the constant pity party after things go wrong. Her 18 birthday is tomorrow but now I don’t even know if we are still going through with our plans because I haven’t gotten any updates and I don’t know what’s going on anymore. So, is it selfish of me to feel this way? I know I’m being dramatic but I need to hear another POV. Srry for the rant.',\n",

I don’t truly understand my emotions because I think all I want is to feel something. I have no other clue but to call it fake emotion. Fake emotion; it’s funny because I think I found something so amazing about myself. That emotions I feel are fake and not even close to real. I fake the way I act, talk, and even the smile I put on. I cant tell right away but I always know. Deep down I know. I live a great life yet I if feel as if it’s worthless to true happiness. I believe that all my emotions are to the idea of filling space.

       "  'Text': 'I’m a young adult male living in Canada and I’ve just been given to the go ahead to return to university. Over the last couple of years my confidence in my intelligence has completely plummeted. I feel and think way slower than I ever used to. Or, at least from what I can recall. For context, I was homeschooled for a sizeable chunk of my elementary education (grade 3-8) and this has resulted in pockets of knowledge being completely gone. This has had enormous setbacks on my secondary learning, but somehow, I made it to university. My first month was a whirlwind of confusion and nervousness. I even somehow got in a relationship with this girl I met from the summer. \\n\\nWhen I first started I was completely overwhelmed and I quickly fell behind. Eventually I was handed a required to withdraw letter. This really hurt me, and I was desperately committed to getting my undergrad. My girlfriend at the time had completed her second year and was doing really well. She encouraged me to continue school and not let it set me back. So I petitioned and won, but I was told to take a fundamentals of learning class for the next year. Fast forward to my second year I moved in with a group of friends. It was around this time I (gaming with a few online friends) got into strategy games and someone told me to take an IQ test. I thought it was odd but the guy I often played with constantly bragged about it, and genuinely believes in it. I should preface before that also around this time I was going through a massive cannabis phase and was practically smoking everyday. This killed my drive for school, but certainly made strategy games more fun. So I take this test, and lo and behold I get an average score. This did not contribute much to my diminishing confidence in my intelligence. I don’t know if being high can affect your score , but I don’t think that’s the point here. The point is I’m scared that no matter how hard I try to improve my way of thinking, I’ll never be able to achieve my goals. From a young age I’ve always wanted to be an author, and when I got to high school I realized I wanted above all else to be an intellectual. I got really into philosophy, politics, history, and English literature but I fear I hardly retained anything, or rather didn’t learn enough in comparison to my peers. I’m worried in a lot of ways I feel like I got wrapped up in the persona of being an academic more than actually being one. At the end of my second year due to a pot addiction, low confidence from the a general intelligence test, and the grades from the year before I failed. I was given a debarred letter. This completely crushed me. I moved back in with my grandmother (who I was staying with before I started university) I slipped into a depression and lost nearly 20 pounds, I would just lay in bed, vaping and smoking pot all day. I hardly did anything that wasn’t a short-term based reward and my relationship with my friends and my girlfriend began to deteriorate. I often contemplated suicide, because if I wasn’t intelligent and couldn’t understand the great many things I am curious about then, I felt like I had lost something I cherished. The validation of doing well in academics was something, sorry, is something I crave. I think it was embedded in my skull from when I was a kid and I think there’s a barrier preventing me from achieving it. \\n\\nSome of my family and friends have validated me as a smart person, and I appreciate them for it, but they’re playing into my insecurity. I have a hard time believing anything regarding my intelligence , even from professors or teachers. I think I’m in a permanent downward spiral. Near the end of the summer I broke up with my girlfriend. She was heading into her master’s degree and I wanted to move in with her but she said no. She wants to live alone and continue her education and eventually move into her career. I was hurt because at that point we had been dating for well over 2 years. Ultimately I understand why, and I don’t think less of her for it. When I decided to end things it was because I realized I am dragging her down and constantly comparing  myself to her successes. \\n\\nAll and all l want to improve the way my brain processes information and effectively make myself more tailored for academics but I am scared that I can’t, that I’ll never be who I want to be. I just want to know if this is actually something I can improve? \\n\\nThanks to anyone who reads this mess of emotions.',\n",

She told my cousins and my dad all of these lies and my cousins turned against me and she turned my brother against me. Today she told my mom that I have a boyfriend and how I’m “boy crazy” when I never even had a bf before and I barley see my bf as it is because I’m trying to get my license and work hard in college. My dad is in the hospital for a brain injury and she got out last week and I’ve been helping him with everything. Today she told my mom how I don’t help my dad with anything and how I don’t care about him. Which Is pretty messed up because I do. My sister has been trying To ruin my life for several months now and I didn’t even do anything to her. I’ve been mentally struggling on my own and I told her ab my Mental health and she basically said how she doesn’t give a fuck. I told her ab my past traumas and she goes around switching up the story telling my mother all bullshit that I ever said . Now my whole family hates me and I just want to die. I want to kill myself and I’ve been trying to look up ways to but ofc there’s so fucking source. I’ve been kind to all of my family members and even my friends can back me up when I say that I’ve been trying to get my life together and I have been helping my dad. I’m so sick of this beef with my sister to the point where I’ll just let her win and kill myself. Everyone has a future and thinks ab their future but when I see mines, it’s blank, maybe it’s a sign that I should just end it all?',\n",

So lately I've been unhappy but not like super sad but I just don't feel happy. I can't bring myself to do anything anymore and people keep telling me how I look unhappy all the time and how I'm not like I used to be and I have just had no motivation what so ever. I've been waking up late not doing my homework not brushing my teeth or showering I've just not had any motivation to do so and I keep telling myself I will but when it gets to that point I don't. It's been like this ever since I lost a lot of my friends because my best friend doesn't want to be friends with me which caused my other friends to not talk to me as much. I've really just been in a funk and I asked if mabye I could see a psychiatrist but I will have to wait a few months. I'm not looking for a diagnosis or anything I just would like some answers please.\",\n",

       "  'Text': 'I’ll make this short. Growing up everything was perfect. No issues. All good. And since I was in grade one I wanted to be a policeman. I was a firefighter for a bit and in 2004 I followed through with a life goal. \\n\\nI actually remember telling people that I had an awesome life with no childhood trauma or any other trauma to speak of. Clean background and psychological. But in 2013 my life got flipped, turned upside down. \\n\\nPolicing changed me. It broke my brain. I went through some really hard stuff (how about the FBI raiding YOUR house) and a divorce (shocker!) and a bunch of other cop shit. I got accused of a crime and I’ll tell you what- talk about life altering circumstances. Especially when it’s on the news. \\n\\nI actually was cleared through investigations since I didn’t do anything wrong. But the damage was done. My name, that I worked so hard to get, was tarnished. Cops believe if you look guilty, you are. There’s no alternative. \\n\\nIt ruined me. Everything I worked so hard for, was over. And it was partly my fault. All at the same time I was juicing and spent all my time in the gym. I was super anal about how I looked in uniform. Obsessed. And I got massive attention from women, which inflated my ego like crazy. I had an affair with a co worker. I wound up turning into a raging asshole. Then, because I was on steroids, I had terrible breakouts on my back. Sooooo I was put on Accutane. \\n\\nI had every side effect BUT hallucinations. However, the suicidal ideation was fucking brutal. On two separate occasions, I was put on admin leave and had all my guns taken by my Sheriff and Chief Deputy after being called to my apartment at 2am. I wrote on one bullet casing “I’m Sorry” for the investigators to find.  \\n\\nFast forward several years and I’m still mentally crushed. I tried getting back into the career a few years ago, but the passion was gone. Long gone. I let my state certification lapse and that was it. \\n\\nI have terrible PTSD with police. I hate them. I want to fist fight every cop I see. I want to film them and piss them off, because, well I know EXACTLY where the line is, and I’m acutely aware of my constitutional rights (especially 4th &amp; 5th). I want those assholes away from me. Cops can eat a bag of dicks. \\n\\nI didn’t get to finish my 20 and retire to something else. And I’m super pissed about that still. \\n\\nI need to forgive myself for how I behaved. I’m embarrassed and ashamed I was acting the way I was. I was turning into a cocky asshole and was obsessed with my own damn self. The FBI thing- yeah that super stressful but I was cleared. However that, plus the divorce, plus the annihilation of my mental health, the loss of my career, and a ton of other small shit- it’s a lot for me to handle. \\n\\nI’m coming off a suicidal mindset from last week. I can’t keep doing this. Tomorrow I’m seeing my PCP about adjusting my meds. And I’m back with my therapist, an ex Air Force Captain who specializes with PTSD for military and cops. He had a whole battalion wiped out and survived. He knows his shit. \\n\\nThree important footnotes:\\n\\n1: I don’t drink alcohol. It’s just not my thing. Cannabis helps a lot when I use in small doses. It’s a part of my overall therapy and my doctor prescribes it. Booze sucks. \\n2: my wife and I remarried exactly one month after the divorce was finalized (per state law)\\n3: I just sold my guns. I’ve got to be proactive about this. I’ve got to survive this. My family needs me. And Im tired of crying. It’s all I do now. \\n\\nThanks for reading.',\n",

The words physically won’t leave my mouth so u figured I’d go to strangers on the internet. It seems like a good plan rn. I guess I should warn you that this may be triggering to some people, so if your in a position where you may be vulnerable or something of the sort please don’t feel obligated to read this. I’d rather not drag people down with me so please go get better for the both of us ok. With that out of the way I suppose I should begin. I can’t cry but I feel emotions. Well sort of. I just feel angry or like obsessively happy in short bursts. I kinda wish I was completely numb. The happiness always hurts so bad when it leaves. But I can’t cry unless it’s to a song. I want to, but I just can’t. I feel like an alien. What kind of person can’t cry. Idk. Everything hurts all the time and there’s only so much Advil can do. And I just feel like I’m waiting for something to either save or kill me. I’ve been more reckless as of late. I haven’t gotten hurt though. Which I hear is supposed to be a good thing. Who would’ve thought. I’ve been like obsessively controlling my diet and I think it’s seriously starting to affect me. I mean I passed out on the couch last night and nearly fell down the stairs this morning. I don’t even do it to make me love myself more. I want to feel the sick. I like it. I think that’s a problem too. I mean it feels nice in a way. Every dizzy spell makes me think good it’s working. I’m probably crazy. Yeah definitely crazy. I kinda hate everything I used to love, and god my friends must be so done with me. I mean I would be . I’m pathetic. I can’t even read it’s like the words get shoved in a blender and spit out as book soup. I joke but man I’m so tired. A cold nap in the rain might be nice. It’s been raining lately, I like the smell of rain. I don’t think my friends will be able to smell it without thinking of my Anoying voice explaining the intricacies of why it smells. My friend probably hate me rn, I know they can see it . I’m not my usual self. Have to be strong those idiots need me to be there. I mean my issues suck but they’re genuinely struggling with mental disorders. Ha it’s kinda selfish I’m ignoring them rn, I know their struggling so I can’t bother them with my stupid issues. I shouldn’t even be bothering you guys but here we are. I don’t know where I’d start they think I’m fine. I think I’m sick again I’m kinda dizzy so the spelling may get bad from here. I’m sorry. I think I’m also kinda worried that everything is actually fine and I’m just struggling for no reason. I don’t think it’s normal the way I’m counting my calories. It’s like a game. How low can that number go. I don’t want to hurt them . My friends. God your probable tired of me mentioning them. I miss them. I miss the times when I wasn’t their therapist. I’m glad I can help and they deserve that. But I miss being just kids on the playground. The rain reminds me of them. I wonder if they’d even remember the smell of the rain if it stayed dry all winter. I’m selfish. I’m tired. I’m gonna end this here sory this is a bit of a waste of time. If you have advice I’d love To hear it. And if this is normal and I’m just dramatic let me know. My friends are calling I’ve got to go. Good night redit.',\n",

Nothing day to day is enjoyable now either, is it just going to go down hill from already rock bottom? I bring up my uncertainty with the concept of working for so little benefit and all I get back is a 'Thats life'. \\n\\nIf that's life, then thats not one I want to live. I would just rather kill myself than be forced to work a horrible life. *its not worth it*\\n\\nSure I like watching YouTube or tv shows when I have the time and a few videos make me laugh here and there but what else is there? I have a few hobbies but everything feels so laborious and tiring to do. School work makes me exhausted, my small business makes me tired, interacting with people makes me exhausted. Worst part is I use to be an extrovert. \\n\\nI sleep a fuck ton of hours every night and everytime I get home from school I am sleeping 6 more. Oh yeah and everytime I sleep I have a 50% chance of getting a nightmare. And my therapist has no clue why. Whenever I try to fall asleep I just imagine all the ways I could kill myself, hanging, sliting my throat, a gun, slitting my arties open, falling out of a multi story window and crack my head on the concrete, spear through my head, and more. \\n\\nThen I have don't know where to start for what I want to do when I graduate high school in a year. I do my school work, I go to school, I get good grades but there is no enjoyment in it. I hate it and I have been at my breaking point for a few months now. I do everything because I have to, what if I just said fuck it and stopped? Either way my life is going to be shit. \\n\\nIn addition to my life sucking almost everyone else does too. The world is fucked, both in morality and the climate. Sweatshops, slave labor, homelessness, greedy billionaires that are destroying the world.\\n\\nI been hit hard the past few years with the realization of how fucked up the world is. Sure that sounds fucking cheesy, but with all the fucked up shit why does it matter anymore? \\n\\nI addition I feel so lonely. I have 1 friend that I interact with outside of school and I barely text or hang out with him cause I don't got energy. Everyone thinks of me like I am weird cause they all thought I was gay (I am bi but I hate that they just assumed that of me). The only guy there who wanted to be my friend is the guy I mentioned before and that's just because he is clueless about gay stuff and doesn't gossip n stuff. \\n\\nI wish I just could kill myself or even get a terminal disease but I have responsibilities, I have pets that love and rely on me. Is my misery worth it for them? If I did kill myself would my parents be able to take care of them? (I have some exotic pets that they would not want to take care of when I am gone)\\n\\nI keep all this shit to myself because I don't want to be thrown into a psych ward.

So today, we had a practice for our role play, and I\\'m the president so obviously I had to take over in managing the actors (aka my classmates), and I noticed that my bestfriend (calling her A) kept talking to my old classmate (calling him that because he was my old classmate from my old school who transferred to my new school, we\\'re classmates anyway now). Anyway, the way she sneakily talked to him and just let me feel sad, I mean, I know I don\\'t have the right to own her or whatsoever, but it felt disappointing seeing them so happy and I had to be serious. I guess it involves my attachment issues, because I get attached easily to people I newly meet even. Continuing, I felt more and more uncomfy as they went to a farther area to just talk, it honestly made me think, \"Am I annoying her? Is she getting tired of me?\" , considering that me and her have been friends for over a year now. Anyway, \"A\" and my old classmate (along with another friend) are at the mall right now, and it makes me sadder that they\\'ll most likely get closer and might even talk bad about me or shit, I don\\'t know what to think anymore. Going back, after the practice, I went home and suddenly got filled with thoughts, \"Do they find me annoying at School?\", \"Am I smelly that they don\\'t wanna go near me?\", \"Am I getting annoying for being loud?\", and more and more thoughts. Along with those thoughts, I then started thinking, \"Which friend group do I actually belong in? Do I even belong in one?\", I thought as I looked back to my old friend group (still my friends now), where I can\\'t relate to them anymore since they study in a school different from mine, while my friend group in my current school, well, I don\\'t feel that I belong there. This is one question that always came up my mind but I left unanswered as I denied it countless times, but, I actually wanna know now, do I actually belong in a friend group? and if so, where?',\n",

In my opinion all of this start when I was younger I don’t have the best relationship with my father he was always there but I feel as though I feared him more than I loved him I always tried to basically stay of of his way… when ever I messed up and needed to be disciplined I feel like the stuff he did was just over the top he may have had a good reason for doing so but a lot of the time It was just over the top for example being whooped to the point where I had noticeable marks and bruises on my legs to the point I had to put makeup on them to cover them up so the teachers didn’t call child services or getting my ass beat around the house to the point where after I had throw away my school shirt covered in my blood and whip my blood off the walls before anyone else got home just to name a few situations…. In my mind I just thought it was normal in both of those situations I had done something wrong rather it’s being a dumb kid getting suspended from school or just being a class clown. It basically got to the point where I was fine just being by myself and holding it all in now that I am 26 yrs old with 2 kids I fear that I will become him only because that is the only role model of a father I know… and the reason why I never thought to seek out help until now is because I felt as though I was weak and not a man to do so because there are people had it way worse so who am I to complain just man up and deal with it…. It got so bad to the point that my wife felt as though she couldn’t come to me about things and that is exactly how my mother felt about my father… So that has caused a ripple effect in my marriage to the point where instead of us fixing our problems and working on them I told her I wanted a separation….. did I have a valid reason for doing so maybe but was it to the point where marriage counseling or just us opening up with each other couldn’t fix no…. And I let this go on for months I literally would let my insecurities, anger and hurt hold me back from telling her that she is the love of my life and I want nothing more than to work through our problems so that we can live a long life together and be the man that she fell in love with and married…I honestly don’t know where to go from here I know I need self help to work through my own issues',\n",

       "  'Text': \"I was about 12,13 when I started throwing up my food. It got to the point where my hair would fall out more and my teeth were sensitive. I was tired and miserable. I've been engaging with this until about the age of 16,17 where I finally realised it was bad and my body was deteriating. I went from 67kg to about 48kg and my main weight would be about 50ish. I was in the closet because my ex boyfriend and his friends would make fun of me for being gay (I have short hair and there were rumours about me and my ex bestie...who I did actually had a crush on in school...she kept kissing me and hugging me but nothing really came out of it. Thank goodness for that...She's a whole other can of worms...).\\n\\nAnyhow, I was happier with my body and at a healthy, skinny weight. It never went below an unhealthy point  I made sure of it so it wasn't obvious I had problems. I got told by boys who became my new form of validation that I was beautiful but, if I got skinnier, it'd be too much. That made me self conscious as hell. After I came out, I stopped seeking male validation and a lot of my...ex lovers??????? Told me they knew I was gay all along and all that bullsh!t. My ex best friend and her bf would make snarky comments about calories (and the people I slept with) when we'd go out to eat...it wasn't fun being around them because a lot of that stuff was hitting a nerve.\\n\\nEventually, I stopped restricting food and I began exercising. I lift weights because my arms were flappy and I do cardio on a stair climber. Now my butt and arms are huge and firm...so are my thighs. My thighs are massive. I look like a caricature...like one of those anime girls from those hentai game ads. People tell me I'm hot. I keep getting shrexual invitations from a few people but I want nothing to do with it. Someone asked me why I don't swim. The answer is that I don't want my body to be visible to anyone. It's sexualised by people I don't want to be sexualised by and I hate the way it looks. All the wrong parts get attention...I just want to be smaller, not this huge anime hentai b!tch. It doesn't help my nan has the same figure as me so I don't see an attractive woman, I just see my nan when I look in the mirror. She's not ugly and I don't think she looks bad but it looks super weird on me.\\n\\nI weight like 60kg plus now. I have a huge ass, huge thighs, my neck is fat and so are my arms. I can't handle being a woman, getting periods, having these massive food cravings and having my belly swell up and get bloated every fucxing month! My mum is overweight so talking to her about this is hard and I'm just so conflicted about myself...not to mention that ex bestie supposedly started a conspiracy to debunk me being gay cuz I used to sleep with boys...I think she made advances on me when we were friends and when we'd get drunk. She'd make comments about my body but I didn't buy into it because...well, we were drunk and I didn't wanna have that boundary broken with her... she's dating a man who she thought I wanted to get with...hence the conspiracy.\\n\\nLong story short: I get told I'm pretty but I hate the way my body looks and people are massive perverts. I'm not asexual, just tired.\",\n",

I try to find some enjoyment in it - and manage to do. But the enjoyment I find is only temporary and lasts a couple of days then I go back to how I’m feeling now. I don’t really have any friends as I stopped talking to my friend group just before lockdown, due to being tired of the jokes they made. I don’t regret my decision. I have occasionally spoken to them since leaving the friend group and they still haven’t changed. I haven’t made any new friends since, due to the fact that I’m introverted and don’t really know how to make them. I guess I do have work friends, but I don’t talk to people outside of work as they’re all a lot older and have different lives to me.\\n\\nI also feel lost with my goals in life. I want to work in the cyber security sector but I find it very overwhelming with the extent of content you need to learn. I had a good study plan but slowly started to lose it. I know I need to stick to it again, I’m just waiting to get the motivation. And I’m not particularly enjoying my current job. But that’s not too much of a problem for me.\\n\\nI think my main problem is that I’m not doing anything with my life. I go home from work and either study for certificates or play games. On weekends I pretty much do the same. I want to change this, I want to start doing different things and be happy with my life. The question is, how can I? \\n\\nAny encouragement or advice would be greatly appreciated.',\n",

I finally had a \"good day\" today where the pain was manageable and I felt like I had the strength to get around to some long overdue chores. Its been lonely and hard, I\\'ve been rather isolated, and in pain through all of this but maintained optimism. Today I couldn\\'t take the way my sheets felt any longer since some of the medications make me sweat at night and I\\'ve spilt/dribbled more than one med shake on them. I got in the shower and felt amazing to feel clean and be moving. Then I threw some bedding in the wash and went about tidying up. Then I heard some awful sounds coming from the basement and discovered my machine had tried to run away and had thousands of error massages scrolling, I messed around with the manual and some basic quick maintenance for a bit but then decided that was a project for another day and if I hurried up and left straight away I\\'d make it into town with enough time to finish washing my bedding. I load up my soggy bin and walk out to my car only to see that the tire is completely flat, sitting on the rim. I started laughing like a lunatic. I got an automated email from HR about my return date and laughed even harder. I am currently sitting on a bare mattress with a decorative throw from another room eating some beans and rice alternating between sobbing and laughing like the joker between bites. I know that none of this is funny. Like ironic maybe that all I wanted was a clean bed and I broke all of the things that could help with that. I posted someplace else thinking I just want someone to laugh with me and now I\\'m starting to think this may actually be some kind of breakdown but I\\'m not feeling stressed like there is nothing I can do right now it is what it is, but why is it suddenly so funny. Like I do not have the means to deal with all this and have been concerned about a lot of other things that are far more serious and normally I would sit down and process then just work on what I can or say it just has to wait and carry on. I am now laughing uncontrollably and thinking I may have just cracked but how do you know. Is laughing just a weird coping thing since I cant fix it? Can some one just help me make it make sense. \\n\\nMoral of that story; How does one know if they are having a mental breakdown? Also... why the crazy laughs? Is this normal?',\n",

It made me feel heard, like I'm not the only one struggling with mental health - so thank you. I'll keep the background brief, but I need some help on how I should proceed with this situation I'm in. \\n\\nI am a recovering drug addict, currently I have been sober for almost a year in December. I started addiction shortly after COVID started, by substituting an early adulthood of binge drinking for opiods. My history with substances runs deep, and for this story you just need to know that it's something that runs in my family and I have been the victim of it since I was a child. Mixed with past trauma, handling the stress of COVID, and trying to hold down a family and fiance, opiods were a way to make all of those problems go away. Once my fiance left me the first summer of COVID, and we lost our house from the awful job market back then, I needed A LOT of medicine to cope. Before I knew it, I couldn't function without it. Fast forward to last year and addiction turned me into a monster. I lied and cheated all of my relationships with family and friends, laying my head on the streets and did anything to get my fix. At it's worst I didn't care if I lived or died tomorrow; walking aimlessly through life and failing any attempt to get clean. \\n\\nWhen you're an addict it seems like bad things that happen to you tend to get worse the longer you stay addicted. When it rained it poured, until I was shot point blank in early December, from an altercation with someone who tried to rob me. I survived with 2 inches less of my colon, 1 less kidney and PTSD. At the same time it was a blessing, because the hospital set me up with a medication assisted treatment and an outpatient rehab for six months, while I recovered. On top of signing me up for Medicaid and providing me with a Motorola and 30 days of service. I spent 3 life changing weeks in the trauma unit growing stronger from my wound and in recovery. My family who I previously had hurt very badly, decided that I had the best chance of long term success back in my parents house. I accepted their offer and was able to complete my outpatient and maintain my medicated addiction therapy.\\n\\nWell that was almoat a year ago, and besides being fully healed physically, life is looking up for me. To anyone who hasn't tried Subutex for opioid addiction, it helped me out a lot, if you give the medicine a chance to work on you. My parents bought me new clothes over time, a new laptop, and made sure I was fed. They wanted to make sure I just focused on healing and recovery. I spent the first six months regrouping all my obligations and degaulting my debt, and finishing rehab. Then I got a really good job with their help too. And ended up saving for a really nice fuel efficient car in July. Currently I am almost ready to move, but need a little more savings. Basically I'm trying to communicate how far I've come, and it really is making my mom proud. I mean I never stole from them but I did lie and borrowed too much money, as well as cut all contacnr from them when I was using. Other immediate members of the family have also hurt them too, so after what I did everyone has very strong opinions on addiction, so recovery at home was very supportive financially but emotionally it was hard sometimes. \\n\\nHere's the problem. My dad's brother has been doing everything in his power to make sure others in the community are aware of my past and has actually led to a local fundraiser for me to get canceled, and a few old friends becoming distant. It all started when my mom refused to sign a contract he drafted that basically said my mom or dad wouldn't let me borrow money, use their car, not steal from them, lie to them, use drugs ever again, submit to random urine tests, not able to leave the house unsupervised or return late, and a few other privacy and privilege restrictions. My mom said that it was unnecessary and that I needed posative reinforcement and room to rebuild trust through putting in the nessisary work, and that a contract was too restrictive and black and white. I guess he blew up at her and said that she lets me do whatever I want and pretty much disowned her and me. He's also our neighbor and lives like right across the street, and our community is very very small town kinda vibes. Anyway, since then he's done everything he can to get me kicked out, and shunned from the community because he basically thinks all addicts are criminals and I'm just gonna take advantage of my mom and dad. Here's some examples of what he's done.\\n\\nOn my first follow-up with the surgens I had to see them in the city I used drugs in. I was still in pretty bad shape and a bus wasn't realistic, because of all the walkig I'd have to do getting to transfer busses. So the only solution was to take my mom's car. I had to get my staples out and this annoying drain tube. Anyway my uncle had my dad so worked up and worries that I was going to buy drugs out there he made me stay on the phone with him the entire drive. I guess my uncle did nothing but scare my dad with all the possible things that could go wrong if I bought drugs, to the point I remember he was kinda goinf crazy at one point and tries to persuade my mom that he could take staples out and tube himself. Then about a month later I grew a big abscess on my kidney from secondary infection, got a bad fever and started shaking and sweating so bad my mom called 911. My uncle saw the ambulance and came over very fast and was posative I was detoxing. He wouldn't drop it and actually convinced them I relapsed until my brother who is a long term addict was like u don't get a fever in detox. They were actually Cold while I was recovery I'm hospital over phone like really Cold, until my bro talked to them. Then once I started working, my mom and dad gave me a bday card to give to the same brother. After work my uncle saw my car there and immediately called my dad to tell him that I was at my brother's and had probably already relapsed. At this point my dad knew this was going too far and said that they told me to stop by his house. Other honorable mentions is that he told the entire high school staff cuz he's a maintenance guy there to stop a charity fundraiser they were doing for me to get back on my feet from getting shot. He told them all that I was still doing drugs and my mom enabled me and the fundraiser would go to waste. They actually ghosted us and I never got any money. He admitted to following me several times. This one's good: he actually spent every Wednesday when the paper came out and called every job add to beware of my name when applying because of my past and wanted to protect the community from getting harmed by me. It took 6 months of steady applications to get a job until my mom got her bff to hire me at her financial firm cuz she was in a different county too. He has called every member of our extended family and told them about my past and how my mom is enabling me and hopefully someone could talk sense into her. He's randomly called my dad to get him worked up whenever it seems like he's calmed down. Or told him that I shouldn't go on walks or everytime I leave the house I'm buying drugs. This actually effected my dad badly. It wasn't until my mom had me let him have access to all of my random urine anlysis results from my outpatient and medicine treatment. In total I've passed 12 randoms since January. Once my dad knew that he really calmed down.\\n\\n Recently though, he's gotten more desperate to get someone on his side and I think irs because after everything he's done to get me to leave or not progress, it didn't work in the end only caused some streas and slowed me down. Also just so you know he's been told about all the UAs ive passed but he just says those dont tell you anything cuz ppl can cheat them. This is what I need an opinion on. It's been maybe 3-4 months with no drama from him but on Monday he says he saw me parked at a local drug dealers house in my town. When confronted by my parents I told them that I went to the store and parkes my car across the street of store running still cuz it was cold out, and aometimes in mornig the store lot is busy so I'll park acroas the road and leave it running so i can get in and go to work. my dad does it too. I guess my uncle drove by and saw me and has been evolving the story since. There's a little trailer park kinda down the block where I parked and it is a bad area of our little town. Anyway like always my mom knew it was BS but my dad got a little worked up and interrogated me. He almost didn't believe me and was probably the most upset I've seen him during these things, because he was so hung up on why I would t use the parkig lot, until my mom convinced him that he used to park how I did all the time. We'll everyday since, my uncle isn't giving up on this cuz hes also hung up on why I wouldn't juat use the parking lot. He really thinks he's onto something and fibally has the proof that I'm actually a souless junkie who never really got better. But each time my dad's confronted him about it my uncle says something new like he heard me and some guy got caught doing a deal in April and me and my brother were seen smoking on the way home from a family reunion, and he's seen me smoke in my room at home. And that he has a source he can't reveal to my dad and won't tell him why. My mom's convinced my dad that until he reveals the source stop listening to him because he's just trying to get me kicked out. My dad had just enough doubt for whatever reason and made me buy a home UA today. And actually went into bathroom with me and watched me urinate. I passed obviously, but at the cost of me crying all day because I have to do extra work and demeaning humiliation urine test on top of all the progress I've worked hard for and graduating rehab, and maintaining a clean Dr UA record. It just isn't enough for my dad and others who believe my uncle to put trust in me again. I'm a year into recovery and Im doing really good but I'm just as criminalized as I was when I used. Anyway now my uncle has convinced my dad that the one I bought was a fake one and my uncle's going to tell my dad which one to buy and have it verified by a lab. He's also convinced my dad to do random UAs on top of my Subutex UA. Meanwhile my uncle continues to spread lies cuz my mom's sister called tonight saying my uncle called about me buying drugs again cuz he saw me parked weird at the store...what do I do???\",\n",

I'd like to spend more time with him, but anytime I try to talk with him, he always has several other people inviting him to do things.

So we weren’t comparable at all and I didn’t feel loved or cared about in the relationship and I realized I was using it to get love and affection in my life because I can’t even look at myself in the mirror. Once I realized that I broke it off with her cause she didn’t deserve it. Then she went off and has made a bunch of posts on her tik tok about me and painting herself as perfect and that I am a horrible person and yeah I messed up. I was distant sometimes and I didn’t give her everything she deserved but I wasn’t mean to her or an asshole… just really mentally ill and that’s why I broke up with her and I’m angry with life that she messed up too and now she got a new bf and is living her best life (when I’m not venting and more stable I am happy for her. I’m happy she found someone who can actually take care of her and treat her as good as possible) but I am really upset that I don’t get to have my good life. I’m struggling with my mental health more then ever before. I am also developing anger issues which scares me. (Just punched a wall hard enough I dented it and my hand is tingling) I have been going to therapy for 2 years now and I have tried one med but don’t have the energy or emotional availability to try more meds. I’m probably not gonna get out of bed tomorrow. It’s been a fight for the past month to get out of bed. I can’t sleep due to insomnia, anxiety and depression and I just don’t know what to do in life.

I actual\\n\\nly regret even bringing it up, because I feel like it\\'s had a negative impact on my relationships with my friends and my partner.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m tired all the time, which makes it hard to stay on top of things, because most nights are a couple of hours of vivid nightmares followed by about six hours of lying awake battlin\\n\\ng intrusive thoughts. These are mostly things that I feel angry about, and then I feel even more angry, and angrier still that they\\'re keeping me from getting to sleep. I feel utterly \"stuck\", unable to move in any direction to find a solution.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI don\\'t know if anyone\\'s experienced anything similar, but if there any suggestions on where to look next I\\'d like to hear them.\\n\\n\\\\~',\n",

       "  'Text': \"My apologies for any spelling/grammar issues  \\n(English is my first/only language I'm just really fucking stupid)\\n\\nTo start I want to clarify that I am lucky to find myself in a spot in life where I don't have suicidal thoughts and I am able to, albeit barely keep a full time job.\\n\\nWhen I say I'm effed up, I mean a bunch of small things. Small things like seeing myself as fat and ugly even though I've lost weight and people have told me I look at least averagely handsome, I struggle to trust others, I mask a lot (start to when I was \\\\~13 and still do in my mid 20's), I'm a perfectionist, I struggle to see and accept my successes/others compliments and have a tendency to over react/over think my failures/others insults, people around me say I have imposter syndrome, I struggle to talk to others/talk at all, I have a very tiny social battery (was like that even before Covid) and will end up avoiding my friends because it is too much to talk to them, and over all I just think I purely exist as a bother to those around me. I do try and negate this by being there for them or helping them with tech issues &amp; what not but still really not enough to negate me being in there life.\\n\\nNow I have had my theory's on why I am how I am but none of them seem large enough or reasonable enough to have caused this. My theory's are\\n\\n\\\\- It's due to my ADHD and/or Depression, but it can't be this because I feel like my issues scale way above my levels of ADHD &amp; Depression\\n\\n\\\\- It's due to being born with a heart disease that causes me to have issues breathing &amp; over all just keep my body pumping blood, but it can't be this because I still get to live life fairly normally I just suck at the pacer test.\\n\\n\\\\- It's due to being the weird mouth breather/fat kid with a speech impediment throughout school, but it can't be this because I still had friends, some of which I am still friends with.\\n\\n\\\\- It's due to a strained relationship with my dad because I would frustrate him as a kid because I was(am) weird &amp; later in life because I struggled keeping a job, but it can't be this because I struggled with keeping a job because of the mental issues.\\n\\n\\\\- It's due to me being a giant manbaby because my mom still treats me as if I were 10 years old a lot, but I hope/don't think it's this because I get frustrated at it when she treats me that way &amp; I've been doing all I can to be independent (still need to move out &amp; get my own insurance though), I feel if I was a manbaby I wouldn't be try to step away from that.\\n\\nBut none of these I feel would be a real cause for how I am, it constantly frustrates me that I can't figure out the reason I am how I am and the more and more I think about it the less and less I feel like I understand. Is it possible I was just born to hate myself and to be worthless? While it seems like the most likely answer to my question in my eyes, I don't want it to be the case, I want to be able to be there for the people I love and to be able to help them just because rather than because I'm a bother.\\n\\nSorry if I got the tag wrong, I feel like this is a mix of a question and a vent, if I tagged it wrong please just delete the post.\",\n",

I can’t talk but thankfully I can move.\\n\\nThe third one happened last year. I sleep on my sides and I woke up and I tired to move off my right side to my left but I physically couldn’t. So I just tired to fall back asleep. Woke up maybe 5 minutes later, extremely uncomfortable right side and I felt pressured on my left side so I kept trying to roller over but I couldn’t for like 15 seconds before I was finally able to move and I got feeling back in my arm. \\n\\nNot to mention from the age of 4-7 or 8 I’d wake up to go to the bathroom, come back and it would be dark for some reason even though the bathroom light was always on for when my and my little sister were toddlers/kids. But I’d see white creatures/“monsters” on the roof, I remember one was pack man with really sharp teeth and one was a really tall figure like slender man. But I’d try find my bed but miss it and for some reason go on the floor but eventually find my bed. If I didn’t find it in time they would come swoop at me. And if I did get into bed some would would swoop me anyway rest would disappear but I’d just go under the covers for like a few minutes and wait before coming back up. I don’t get them anymore thankfully. But it would ALWAYS happen in my mum and dads room.\\n\\nI’m open to any questions, if it will help',\n",

I don\\'t want to live a lie or in a delusion. I would give anything to have been born male, but that\\'s not possible.

Then my mother compared her with her neighbors (the neighborhood kids are the same age as my sister), and then called her \"Stupid\", \"Study\", \"My family has more conditions than others.  but can\\'t study well.\", \"Bring all the books down here and burn them all, no need to go to school!\"\\nAnd when she cried and went up to arrange her things, her mother told me to come up and tell her to just come down and apologize and promise to do better next time.\\n Well this situation has been going on since she was in 5th grade (she\\'s in 7th grade now).  When she was in 5th grade, she played games and watched comic books a lot, so her grades dropped (I\\'m telling the truth, not blaming anything).  And my mother started scolding her from that moment.\\n When I went upstairs to meet her today, she was already packing up but I didn\\'t say anything because I saw her still crying.  Maybe it\\'s because of my silence that she couldn\\'t help but confided in me how she felt pressured, how she kept comparing her to the neighborhood kids, she even said she was \"a child\"  I\\'m the most disappointed\", he said if he was so disappointed, then he wouldn\\'t give birth to him anymore, he was tired from his mother\\'s curses, his mother kept talking and talking, until he was eating, his mother still said,  After my mother finished speaking, my father also added a few curse words.  It feels very unsettling.\\n He said that in the 6th grade, his class had an unfortunate friend who passed away due to illness, did he think if he died, would his parents be happier?  Are you happier?  He didn\\'t want to hear the curses anymore, didn\\'t want to hear the comparisons anymore, the more he listened, the more scared he became.  He said he was scared to take a math test today, and every time someone asked, \"Ma\\'am, how many minutes do we have left?\"  is that it feels dizzy, scared, it is afraid of not having enough time to do the test, but the more anxious it is, the more afraid it is of making mistakes.\\nHe also said that his parents made a lot of promises to him but did not fulfill them.  Like the day my dad said he would confide in her but there was no conversation or mom promised to buy her a bottle of eye drops...\\n He also said that in the past he was violently abused by a child near my house (because the other boy is a martial arts boy), so he often beat my sister, she told her mother but my mother didn\\'t care so  it doesn\\'t tell me at all.\\n When she talks about the pressure, she will go online to confide in her online friends, or simply write stories, compose stories.  But she said she has no feelings to write stories anymore, now she can only confide in her friends online but she uses a lot, so my parents think she uses her phone and laptop to play, not  study anything.  Her test scores are low today, so they confiscated her phone, and her laptop is in danger of being confiscated.\\n While she was crying and talking, I could only sit still and listen, because I didn\\'t know what to say.  So what should I do now?',\n",

       "  'Text': 'I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in 2019 and since then, I’ve been taking antidepressants on and off. It’s not easy and some days especially during my period, my brain imbalance is so bad I have no idea what to do. \\n\\nHaving anxiety and depression is not a joke and it’s sad how a lot of people still don’t understand what mental illness is. People say they have been depressed too because their ex broke up with them or they failed a test but honestly, it’s very different. I tell my friends how hard I’m trying but my anxiety can be very bad sometimes and they just say stop being sad, there are millions of people out there who have no food etc like that is supposed to mean I have no right to feel this way. I can’t just stop…🙄 it’s not a simple switch I can do in my brain that changes how I feel. But I understand why they are that way so I can’t blame them…\\n\\nBefore I had this in 2019, I read about people being depressed and see movies of them cutting, or not eating or having panic attacks and I also thought, “why are they not trying to better themselves? Cutting won’t help. They are doing this on purpose to get attention.” \\nBut when a horrible incident happened in 2019 and spiraled out of control, I was helpless. When you get anxiety and panic attacks, it’s like you can literally feel the switch in your brain and you don’t know what to do to stop it. Your heart starts racing, you get light headed and the panic attacks are like the worst…the scariest thing imaginable because you literally feel like you are going to die… it’s hard to explain to someone when they have never had it. It’s not just being nervous or being scared after watching a horror movie and you are scared to go to the bathroom. It’s like your chest starts tightening, your heart goes into overdrive, you scream and cry uncontrollably, you become so lightheaded, your body starts shaking and you feel like burning from the inside and so on. I had my first full blown panic attack and the paramedics didn’t want to take me to the hospital. They came and when my friend explained the situation on the phone to them they said, “Ah so-so. Daijoubo neh? Byouin ikinai. Just relax,” said the older paramedic and left me at home alone because it was “not an emergency and there was no hospital that would take me.” In my mind, I thought I was going to die in this foreign country all alone in this apartment and nobody would know because nobody cared. \\nIt was getting so bad that I remember standing at the top of the roof examining the height and thinking, “Is this high enough to kill me immediately? Hmm… I don’t want to end up paralyzed for life instead.” And at that time that was the only thing stopping me-The building just wasn’t tall enough to kill me…I stood in front of the yellow line so many times hoping to jump when the train comes but thought I didn’t want my family back home to pay for inconveniencing Japanese commuters or having my name plastered across the news and people shaming me for killing myself to the grave. Most of all, I didn’t want God to be disappointed in me. Enough people have left and I couldn’t lose Him too. That was during the height of my anxiety. I didn’t want to die. I had so much to do, to go. But at that moment, the future just looked so bleak,dark and hopeless. When you’re in the void, nothing mattered. It’s like you’re in a trance and you can barely see or hear anybody or anything but your mind…\\n\\nIt gets to a point where you feel nothing but anxiety, of worries, of wanting to hurt yourself to feel something else again. And then medication kicks in, you don’t feel as anxious anymore, but instead you are numb. You don’t feel happy, sad or anxious. You feel… nothing…\\nI do not wish this on anybody, not even my worst enemy. I lost a lot of friends that time because they thought I changed and was just not cool enough anymore or I was too annoying because I cried a lot. Even my own family did not understand and left me to fend for myself and cut off communication with me for months because I was being a nuisance to them.\\nIt’s not easy but I’m getting better. I’m trying to wean myself off the medicine so I can someday live without my medication. \\n\\nI now have the best husband in the world and fur babies that I oh so love. God was always there to shed light. I’ve been feeling depressed these days (specifically this morning) and decided to write this here for others like me and as a reminder for me to read to myself when I’m in the dark again to pull me out. \\n\\nIf you have a friend with anxiety and depression, please don’t tell them they are being petty; there are worse people in the world; they also haven’t paid their phone bill this week unlike you who have unlimited plan; not to be a lump and just be happy and content. \\n\\nJust… be kind and tell them you know it’s not easy and they are strong for still fighting and one day they will come out the winner. Be patient, be understanding and most of all, just be there. No words, no cheering, but just being there is the best thing you can ever do. Just be kind… Thank you for reading.',\n",

       "  'Text': \"For a bit a context, we're both freshman in our first semester of college, and he's a music major. recently he told me he met with his honors college advisor who told him he might be depressed based on what he said to her and how his grades are doing. He's pretty much failing all of his classes that aren't music classes because he either sleeps through them or can't bring himself to care about them (even though he told me he knows he should care). He was asking me what's the point of him being here and what he's even doing. He's constantly comparing himself to the greatest jazz musicians and he literally practices like 6-8 hours a day. He says that he feels like he's making no progress and most musicians don't go to college so what's he even doing. He just sounds so tired. It hurts my heart because I love him so much and he's so incredibly kind and thoughtful. He always takes care of me so well when i'm feeling sad or anxious or insecure so I want to be there for him just like he's there for me. I just don't know how to help him.\",\n",

       "  'Text': 'For reference, i am 20f but identify as gender fluid just kind of accepting the female tag on myself for everyone else’s convenience. \\n\\nAnyways, I can’t tell when this started honestly. It could be in middleschool could’ve been highschool, potentially earlier. As a kid i never had many friends, one or two “real ones” but mainly just been floating in a friend group or between friend groups where nobody was actually my friend they just allowed me to be around them. In primary and early middleschool i was severely bullied, beaten and sexually harassed by boys and girls alike. By late middleschool i had made 2 real friends, one of which i couldn’t regularly see because they lived in a different country. \\n\\nIn highschool my first relationship was essentially me being used for sexual pleasure, bullied and groomed into whatever my partner wanted me to be. I thought it was love because on the surface it seemed nice however i found out he had a “real girlfriend” the entire time. Second relationship was also of a grooming nature, i was freshly 16 and he was about to turn 18, basically same relationship however now drugs and alcohol also got involved as he introduced me into the party scene. After he got bored of me he broke up with me. \\n\\nI later went on to get raped by his friend who i also considered my friend at the time and trusted to be drunk and high around. I now feel uncomfortable drinking around people. \\n\\nWhat really made me realise that i cannot escape my need for suffering is my current relationship. Despite still being young and stupid i allowed myself to just fully submit myself to this person, and even though he is same age as me, comes from a good family, is a good person, i still found myself suffering the first two years we were together because i kept instinctively provoking him to be cold to me and crying about it afterwards. He also got his own demons to be fighting, like his unhealthy perfectionism and severe anxiety that’s causing him to be judgemental of everything but we have talked about it and he’s getting professional help along with him putting in personal effort to be better.\\n\\nNow were 3 years into the relationship, we have talked about my past and how we should handle everything and express our feelings and needs but now that everything is fine i feel… bored. Something in my messed up head wants to suffer again. I physically ache from the boredom. I am so tired of my boring life. I have nothing going for me at the moment and i’m filling the void with hobbies and part time jobs or volunteering but i’m still so bored. \\n\\nSo bored that i don’t see the point in living. I’m not actively suicidal i don’t think about death too often and i hate pain so i wouldn’t do it unless i was despaired but i’m just so tired of this boredom. I’d just like some advice. i can share more about my life within reason if that’s necessary.',\n",

       "  'Text': 'Hi everyone.\\n\\nI am a 33 year old woman dating a 35 year old man. We have been together for 9 years. I\\'m going to try and be very factual and fair, and present the good with the bad. \\n\\nI\\'ll cut right to the chase: he gets overwhelmed at many things that you or I would not bat an eyelash at. Right now the current thing that is overwhelming him is having to take our dog to the vet. I have been away for work for 5 weeks and she has a relapse of a urinary tract infection. [As an aside: I know it is not easy to be alone and not have anyone around you to help or to even talk to, but this is how our relationship has always been: I make frequent work trips that are 3-5 weeks at a time.] But getting back to the subject at hand, our vet is less than 3 blocks from our house and is a 5 minute walk. It\\'s also an easy visit. All she needs to do is either pee in a cup there, or he can bring some urine from home. Our dog loves the vet and has no problem going. But he\\'s basically shut down because he\\'s alone and he\\'s not answering my calls or texts and I don\\'t even know if he is taking her. The last text I got from him \"I\\'m numb.\"\\n\\nThis is not the first time that a normal, everyday thing has made him so anxious and overwhelmed that he\\'s shut down. He\\'s shut down over things ranging from having to clean the house while I am away, possibly having a gas company tech come to our house (our gas tank wasn\\'t working), finding work (he is gainfully employed now), and the possibility of going back to school for better job prospects (I offered to pay for school and it\\'s an online program). I try and make everything easy for him because I know he has a hard time and gets anxious over some things. I literally got him a job with my company and he works from home (he does a great job and has an amazing work ethic) and it\\'s an extremely low stress position. Most of the time he plays video games, lounges around, and does what he wants. Nothing makes me happier than being able to provide that life for him but when he shuts down at things that most people wouldn\\'t, I\\'m honestly at my wit\\'s end and I feel almost like he doesn\\'t have the \"right\" to shut down because I feel his life is on easy mode (I know it\\'s wrong of me to feel this way). But, I am the breadwinner of the house and I often feel like I have to babysit him on top of earning almost all the money and paying for most things (I pay all the rent, I pay most of the bills, etc.).\\n\\nAnother thing that really bothers me is his sleep pattern. He will stay up until 4, 5, 6 am (or sometimes later) and sleep all afternoon and sometimes until the evening. I get it that everyone is different, but this isn\\'t good. It makes me feel like we are living two separate lives because I usually go to bed around 11-12. Sometimes it makes me go to bed even later because I stay up to hang out with him, and it ruins my whole system too.\\n\\nSomething else that worries me is that he flips out when things go wrong. He\\'ll scream at inanimate objects or just start yelling to himself about things if something falls, breaks, or goes wrong. It\\'s funny in the moment but looking back on it, I really dislike it because I often have to soothe him or just completely get out of his way.\\n\\nHow do I help him stop shutting down at things that most people just suck it up and do?\\n\\nTL:DR - Boyfriend shuts down at basic tasks. How can I help?',\n",

       "  'Text': \"I was standing in the living room finishing a beer when the thought came to pick up the hunting knife that had been delivered that week and use it to cut my throat. I went into the bathtub because leaving blood around would make someone's day rotten – I thought that I might as well be polite to whomever finds the body. I sat in the bathtub and I pulled the knife across my neck. The sound was sickening. I could hear meat being cut in my own head. I felt sharp sharp pain then warmth radiating out across my neck and chest as the blood ran out of the wound. I took a deep breath and sat back in the tub. I looked over and saw my dog staring at me. I thought that she looked frightened and that stunned me. I felt like I had suddenly woke up from a nightmare and I jumped up out of the tub and grabbed a towel, pressed it to my neck and dialed 911.\\n\\nThe next thing I remember I was looking at a bright mandala of warn colors and there was a sound to the right of me, something cold and sterile over to my side. I went back to the warm mandala but the sound persisted. Someone was saying my name, I was in an operating room, doctors and nurses had finished suturing my neck which was painfully itchy. I was naked, it was cold. A nurse covered me in a sheet and moved my to another room that was empty. I didn't know where I was or what had happened but I new I had failed to kill myself and that whatever was going to happen, my choices were out of my hands.\\n\\nI was moved to the 7th floor of the behavioral clinic. A locked unit for psychiatric patients that demonstrated severe behavioral problems. I had to be within arm's reach of a mental healthcare worker 24 hours a day. No privacy in the bathroom. I had no clothes and no shoes. I was in a robe and pajama bottoms that the hospital issued lying in a room where my only choice was whether the lights were on or off. No sooner had I fallen asleep on the thin mattress than I was woken by yelling in the hallway. A man was upset and pacing the hall. Whenever he went into his room he could hear his baby sister crying from the floor below. He used the phone on the wall to call his family who told him his sister was at home in her bed and sleeping. He tried to explain to the nurse on duty that his family was lying to him, that his sister was in danger and that he had to get to the sixth floor. After some yelling and more pacing he muttered that everyone was telling him it was his schizophrenia, but he knew better.\\n\\nThe next morning I told the psychiatrist that I was clearly in the wrong place, that this was a place for people who are crazy. She explained that I had 14 stitches in my neck and that is far more serious than hearing voices. No, I was in exactly the right place and wouldn't be leaving for a while.\\n\\nMy reasoning, that I had “chickened out” and dialed 911 was not going to fly with this psychiatrist. What is more, I was told, this was a pattern that psychiatrists identify in suicide cases – the patient is angry at themselves that they survived. Anger at oneself is a symptom. Everyone experiences a bit of disgust over making a mistake or committing a social faux pas, and then there is the persistent self disgust of clinical depression. Repeating silent words of punishment to a pitiful creature who deserves punishment. I deserved to be punished, to be dead, to be a cold corpse in a pool of blood waiting to be discovered by the smell of of rotting meat as it wafted through the corridor of the building where I lived and alerted the neighbors. I deserved it, I was disgusted with myself, and could not bear to keep feeling so worthless and pathetic, it was like chewing on glass. I had a plan, I left a note, I bought a sharp hunting knife with a 7 inch blade,I did everything correctly but I had not thought of the poor dog. I was, as usual, pathetic and selfish, even in suicide.\",\n",

I think it is really easy to get caught up in life’s problems and not take the time to check in on yourself and think clearly about things. \\n\\nI struggle to sleep, and always have. The main culprit is - thinking. In the silence and stillness of the night, my brain goes haywire and the worrisome thoughts keep me up at night. \\n\\nBut I have learned how to use this explosion of thought for good. For the last few weeks I have allowed myself around 30 minutes or so to let my brain unload and reflect. \\nThe thoughts can vary from evaluating the day and any conversations I had, often feeling like I said something wrong or worrying how others judge me. \\n\\n\\nI then typically plan and prepare for the next day and it’s challenges, and simply let myself vent and have an interior discussion with myself. It honestly keeps me sane .\\n\\n\\nAfter a half hour or so, I have to tell myself that I will sleep now and block out anymore thoughts, insecurities, desires from keeping me awake. \\nTo do this I force myself to think of a narrative scenario … this could be exploring a crystal cave or a walk in an enchanted forest or literally anything… the purpose is to disconnect from my own life  and enter another world - this has helped my inability to sleep a lot.',\n",

So I grabbed my phone and airpods and started listening to music and went outside. (I live in a neighborhood) I walked the same way I always do, but one of my neighbors had a backyard with woods in it. Something came over me and I walked into the woods and walked out of the neighborhood into our town. I kept walking straight and found a park behind a church and just started swinging on the swings.\\n\\nThen my feelings came back and I ran home. Now that I'm home I miss it. I wanna run back to that place, nobody to stop me. Nobody knows where i am. I wanna leave my phone because my mom has a location tracker on it. I just want to go back and be alone, I don't even care about the risks of it. And I wanna be numb again because it stops my consciousness, it stops my brain from thinking about what is right and wrong. It would make it easier to run away.\",\n",

       "  'Text': 'Some background:\\n\\nIn the past, I have suffered from physical and psychological abuse by family members and severe bullying. I\\'ve also been assaulted by someone I thought of being my friend. There were moments when I feared for my life. I\\'m no longer affiliated with any of the people who caused me pain. Unfortunately, this has affected me in more ways than I understand now. \\n\\nIt\\'s hard to form relationships because I struggle to set boundaries, which leads to overstepping my boundaries, which leads to resentment and me eventually ending the relationship. I also feel disconnected from people who seem to have had a relatively carefree upbringing. Even when I find the \"right\" people,  for some reason, as the relationship progresses, there is, apart from a feeling of being unworthy of love, a growing anxiety inside of me. It grows to the point of being unbearable, so I end the relationship. I hate it.  At the same time, I seem to be extremely sensitive to rejection, criticism, contempt, and every instance where my trust is betrayed. To the point where my body goes into fight-or-flight mode. I freeze and my heart starts to beat really fast. I have no control over it and I wish it wouldn\\'t be like that. I also developed depression and an eating disorder.\\n\\nDespite the hardship I\\'ve faced, I\\'ve been pretty successful in my academic endeavors. I\\'ve also learned to deal with my depression by exercising, eating healthy,  supplementing, and getting plenty of sleep. I realized that as long as I maintain this, depression isn\\'t a big problem.\\n\\nHowever, recently I\\'ve been getting nightmares about getting killed or bullied by the people who abused me, or very rarely, killing them. I wake up disturbed and unable to fall asleep again.   A lack of sleep disturbs my healthy habits which are absolutely essential for my mental health. It can absolutely make or break my day or even week, depending on how often I have these nightmares.\\n\\nI\\'ve attempted to get psychotherapy once. In the clinical interview, my psychotherapist told me, he suspects that I have PTSD and depression.  Before therapy could begin, I had to change psychotherapists and am now on a waiting list. I\\'m told it will take some months before another psychotherapist will be available. \\n\\nDo some of you have advice on what I can do to fix my sleep? \\n\\n(Sorry, if it is as long as it is.

My friends rarely invite me on any party because they think I'm an introvert (actually, I am), but every time I ask them to hang out with me, they never want to join. My father likes to tell bad things about somebody to other people and people seems can still be friends with him, but once I tell bad things about somebody to my friends, they seem try to avoid me. My friend never started a chat or a call and mostly I was the one who started it, and yet my friend still thinks I love to be left alone. Weirdly, there are my other friend who are more introvert than me, but she often in accompanied with other friends and never abandoned by others. That's all just a few from other problems I had. It's always confused me and makes me angry and sad. I'm trying desperately to be a better person and yet people seem to treat me the same as before. Sometimes I feel guilty to blame on other people. Is it because I live in the wrong circle or because I am an asshole without me knowing it? Or is it a normal thing and I was just overthinking it? I was just trying to do things that people would do to others, yet I get the opposite treatment. The feeling of detach from understand how relationships works, lonely, trust issue, self-hate, and confuse often led me to depression and suicidal thought. I realize sometimes in life, there isn't any accurate formula on builds a proper relationship and it's always 50/50. But I think, mostly in my life, often trap in unfortunate situations.

       "  'Text': 'Hopefully someone can answer my questions. There\\'s mentions of a kid who killed them selves but there are warnings around that paragraph. \\n\\nMaybe I\\'ll start with this. Hey am a teen in high school I don\\'t know why am feeling this way, I know I\\'ve felt this way before but not as bad as it is recently. Like a coupe weeks ago I remember feeling so udderly alone and and tired and stressed and sad and so so so lonely. I don\\'t know how to explain it but the first day I remember coming home and just not knowing what to do. My mom was taking a nap and I went on my way to my room and just laid there feeling so sad and so alone so lonely I don\\'t know how to feel about it. I ended up getting all day maybe waking up at 8-9 in the afternoon then I laid in bed staying up for awhile watching videos and crying and feeling sad and lonely and as I type this I think it may have just been stupid of me to feel this way it sucks and I know some people will be like it\\'s just a phase you\\'ll be fine stuff like that maybe it is just a phase. \\n\\nIt feels so bad and I feel so tired and i wish to be numb sometimes so I don\\'t have to feel how I feel I wish I can numb out that pain and sadness. I don\\'t know why I want to feel that way but maybe someone can help me answer that.\\n\\nI have very few friends and I tend to hold in my emotions. So when I feel upset I don\\'t do or say anything I just let it go and this one girl am friends with in my opinion is spoiled and she knows it, anyways sometimes she says stupid things without realizing the effect it\\'ll have on other people and the first time she said something stupid I got so mad at her and everyone made me apologize because they say I was over reacting but she has no idea how it feels to gone through the stuff I have gone through. The second time it happened was when it felt like her and her bsf were ignoring me and it hurt it made me feel like I was in elementary again. I\\'ve had such a hard time all my life making friends and when I did they would eventually leave me. But in middle school I made a group of friends that were so good to me but then when we got to high school we all parted ways except me and my bsf. Sometimes I talk to the others but that\\'s rare. \\nBut after I got upset the second time someone told me they over heard my bsf talking to the other girl in our friend group about how I was over reacting and maybe I was but I don\\'t know and they kinda made me feel bad so I kinda apologized again and I hate it so much I hate it all and it pisses me off that they always say am over reacting and I hate it so much it drives me so mad and so sad and lonely.\\n\\nSomething else I have a question on hopefully someone has an answer to it. First off I have friends a small friend group for four including me. But two of them I feel like they don\\'t like and would drop me at the first chance they get and sometimes I feel like my bsf might drop me at any chance. I have friends that I rarely talk too as I dated before. I have friends but they feel more like acquaintances than friends since we don\\'t text or speak much. And honestly I feel so jealous of everyone especially my friends because they have friends other than me... I have no one except them and even then I feel like they will leave me in a snap of the fingers. And it hurts and I feel so jealous of them all am jealous of their friends when they hang out with others joke and talk to them and enjoy their own personal jokes that I don\\'t understand I don\\'t know why I feel jealous maybe someone can help me with that.\\n\\nThere\\'s this song that I hear online every now and then am not sure what it\\'s called but it goes something like \"lucky is she who lives unaware who doesn\\'t get brothered by those who don\\'t care, lucky is she who doesn\\'t get bothered by all that\\'s unfair. Unlucky me who knows way to much, who fights to make changed in music and such, unlucky me who\\'s aware of the pain\" when I hear that song sometimes I literally cry because I understand it in a way. I feel like my friends are so lucky that they didn\\'t have to grow up in such a traumatizing environment. My bsf might be able to understand me a little bit but not completely because she also didn\\'t go through stuff I have gone through too. I feel like they are so lucky so so so lucky that they never had to endure the stuff I had to when I was young at the moment I think am very lucky to be in a safer environment but when I was little it was very much a different story.\\nBecause of my childhood with the lack of money I\\'ve been scared to spend money and when I do spend money I hate myself for buying such useless and unneeded things that I love so much that I want that I care about. I hate myself and I am so jealous that they were so lucky to be able to be in the position that they are in. \\n\\n\\nI feel so lonely so tired so annoyed. When I get stressed or been moving around a lot or something am not sure the exact cause of it my boy kinda starts shaking like not my whole body.... Or maybe my whole body but I\\'ve noticed my hand shaking bad and my face near my eyes or nose or mouth and I don\\'t know why and I hate it I hate it I hate it. None of my friends noticed except like two people one is a new friend she\\'s so nice so caring so amazing so sweet the other one is a guy who noticed me after I sat down and was kinda just shaky and he isn\\'t even a friend but he noticed why did he notice why did he speak up why did he say something about it why why why I don\\'t understand why did he notice and say something and try and calm me down when none of my actual friends noticed or say anything I don\\'t understand I don\\'t I really don\\'t. \\n\\nYesterday my mom got mad at me calling me stupid... Maybe I am stupid I am stupid I put drinks on the floor of the car and held the food and as she turned the drinks spilled a bit and she called me stupid and I am why couldn\\'t I give the drinks or food to my brother. She told me later on that it\\'s because I do to much instead of letting others help me and she said she thinks I do it because that\\'s what I\\'ve seen her do through my childhood. Maybe it\\'s true. Maybe I want to carry the world on my shoulder because it\\'s okay if I make everything easier for my friends and family if I can do that one thing help everyone maybe they won\\'t hate me and leave me.... Maybe just maybe. \\nWhy do I feel this way.\\n\\n(Trigger warning for this paragraph suicide)\\nI recently read this suicide note of this kid who killed himself last year and he had a 19 pages of his note. Just letting it all out telling everyone why he did it and it just broke my heart but it didn\\'t make me extremely sad. It was sad it very much was sad.... But I feel like he couldn\\'t go on anymore he explained his feels and it made me so sad to read it but not sad that I cried. He was hurt he was... I explained it to my friend and told her someone else read it and cried but I didn\\'t and I don\\'t know why. She said maybe it\\'s because the girl who read it could understand how he felt and maybe it was me who just didn\\'t understand how he felt. But that\\'s so wrong I could understand how he felt he was in so much pain and I feel like I understood how he felt I understood it and it hurts. There was one point where he said that he wasn\\'t going to kill himself since he had a good day but a few days later he went back to feeling numb and sad it was so sad but so understandable. It makes me sad he didn\\'t get to live his life because of his mental health. I wish so many people could read that and remember him because he believed no one would remember him or understand him he wanted people to use his suicide note to understand the thought inside people\\'s head. He wanted his organs to be donated except his heart and anything to do with his face because he wanted an open casket funeral. I wish people would talk about him he was someone he was human he was so lonely and depressed.\\nAm not saying I would kill myself I am a wimp I say I can\\'t leave my family or friends or online friends and disappear on them. Which is true I could never kill myself because of them... But am also scared of death and what happens after death.\\n(End of suicide trigger warning)\\n\\nI feel so lonely tired and sad stressed and I can\\'t talk about this to anyone I know and they won\\'t even listen to me if I let them know how I feel inside and it sucks so here I am writing this down.\\n\\nFor the time being I don\\'t know what else to write so this is it for today. Thank you for those who read this and for those who have answers for my problems thank you so so much.',\n",

       "  'Text': 'I’ve tried therapy twice now. I had problems with self criticism and a good friend said it sounded like depression, then suggested that I see a therapist. So I did. I decided to try online therapy through BetterHelp because I didn’t know of any offices near me, it’s much more convenient to just take a call. But, I felt nervous about talking on the phone, so I opted for text sessions. And after several months of talking to her, I didn’t feel helped. I talked to her about it and she said that she agreed that I wasn’t really responding to her treatment, and said that if I want, I should try another therapist. The only thing of value I left with was a confident depression diagnosis and a moderately confident ADHD diagnosis.\\n\\nI switched to Cerebral and took the plan that includes medication because I wanted to try antidepressants. I was given a prescription, and talked to that therapist 6 times over the course of 2 months. She wasn’t sure about the ADHD, agreed with the depression, and again, didn’t really help me. She was more forward, she asked me if I felt like she was giving me advice I hadn’t heard before. I said no. She asked if I had any questions about the advice she gave me. I said no. She said, “So I’m telling you what you already know, and you understand it, so there’s no real point for me to repeat my advice right? You already know what you have to do. So why aren’t you doing it?”\\n\\nI didn’t have an answer for that. She said that she would need to think, because she was clueless where she could go from there for our next session. But her final note was that she wasn’t sure I actually needed therapy, and she couldn’t figure out if I’m just looking for validation or attention. Asked for my schedule, set up an appointment next week, said I’d see her then. I cancelled the plan and deleted the app an hour later. After talking to my friends about it, they agreed that it was a mean thing for her to say, but also noted that I haven’t taken their advice to heart.\\n\\nSo I’m here. It’s been 2 months since then, and I’ve noticed my mood degrading, I spend more time venting to my friends, I spend more time angry with myself, and I’m assuming it’s seasonal depression. So I want to try to get myself into a healthier state of mind, because I have no idea what I’m gonna do if this headspace is gonna be what takes up the next few months. I’m at the lowest I’ve been in years and I’d like to avoid hitting an all time low.\\n\\nSo, what do I do? Where do I start? Because I’m wary to try again. I don’t want to throw more money at the problem just to be told that the problem is me, and there’s nothing they can do for me.',\n",

Ever since then I knew my body aged x10 and I also felt the brain fog hit me like crazy. \\n\\nI don’t really know where to go with this but I know I never really talked too emotionally about the crash. I also feel like I haven’t been as smart as I used to be since I got into the wreck either. Remembering things, even simple stuff from just a day or two ago is a troubling. Being in conversation and actually keeping focus is also more challenging. One of the things that get me the most are forgetting the simplest words which make me feel like an idiot sometimes in conversation. \\n\\nIt just hurts me because I never thought I was a genius but throughout highschool I was always in honors class. Went to college and felt like I was doing pretty good up until I got into the accident. And now I’ve finally decided I can’t do this anymore. College isn’t for me and the other options are looking slim. \\n\\nEverything else that happened with the car accident only makes me more sad and to put icing on the cake I was never a good brother to my siblings. I’ve been the shittiest person in this life I’ve lived and I guess you could say it is just for me to be in the spot I’m in. \\n\\nIdk what I was aiming to achieve in this post. Maybe someone saying that it’s possible for a car accident to make you dumber so I didn’t feel less guilty for being such a failure. Or maybe it’s to just put what I’m feeling out there',\n",

Been off meds for almost 5 months and have been stable until recently.\\n\\nI took a break off dating apps and hookups for a few months. From the casual flings I\\'ve bad I tend to have a really destructive pattern that looks like this:\\n\\n1) Have a one night stand. It\\'s understood on both sides that this is a casual relationship. \\n\\n2) Convinced for a week or two that I can move on. Generally act distant or uninterested \\n\\n3) Person strikes convo, acts flirty, or is slightly involved after ONS\\n\\n4) Do another casual thing with person, usually out of my own initiative (there\\'s almost always a second time)\\n\\n5) Person becomes distant after 2-3rd time and texts become dry. \\n\\n6) I become increasingly anxious and paranoid over this, thinking I \"messed up\" and start to crave more out of the exchange..or at least more hooking up\\n\\n7) I don\\'t say anything due to expectations that they aren\\'t my BF or close to me. Mental health rapidly declines as I wait for them to become involved again. \\n\\n8) The few people that stayed involved I continue to decline. I lose sleep out of extreme paranoia (one time thinking if I go to sleep they\\'ll be gone in the morning), become slightly suicidal, and have a unstable mood.\\n\\n9) Occasionally when the connection is cut off I blow up and go on a depressed tangent\\n\\n10) Repeat \\n\\n\\nIt took me a while to notice this behavior. I deleted all my dating apps and nudes. I sworn off romance and sex. I stopped my meds, starting losing healthy weight and went back to school. \\n\\nWith that I started to have confidence. I starting feeling I could be desirable physically and now that I\\'m slightly on the right track, I could handle a little casual fling. \\n\\nI met with someone and could tell there was physical attraction and slight chemistry. But it was a sexual encounter, on a dating app. Again went through phase 1, acting uninterested when they texted me again and again. Now after phase 6 im starting to go off into the deep end. \\n\\nWhy is this happening even when I was on a good track?\\n\\nFor those that think I have BPD, I don\\'t. This mood instability only happens in this kinda situation. I only have personality disorder traits in my diagnosis. \\n\\nMention of CSA and abuse:\\nI\\'m suspecting because of two CSA incidents I\\'m associating healthy relationships with sexual favors/being sexual. Also including that I witnessed a lot of dysfunction in both sides of my family, was abandoned by mom at 16, pressured to resent her (I still missed my mom), saw drug abuse from dad, experienced emotional incest, and dealt with a narcissist parent\\n\\nYes I\\'ve been to many CBT therapists, did open DBT (went horribly), and trauma focused CBT. Going to therapy made me very dysfunctional and my symptoms worsened half the time. I\\'m not sure what to do and if I should try to continue this casual relationship to hopefully heal and trust again (they keep ensuring more hookups and have been the nicest so far). \\n\\n\\nTDLR: Unconsciously think hookups are something more, go down paranoid and depressive spiral, repeat. Stopped this pattern and got healthier, started school, and swore off hookups. Gained confidence and tried one hookup. Suspect CSA has something to do with this.',\n",

Wrong.\\n\\nThis ban did nothing, cause bans only work if the guardian of the kids enforces it, so he ended up wiggling his way back into our lives acting all nice and promising he\\'d changed, he didn\\'t, and I saw right through him.\\n\\nHe hated me the most cause I was \"gobby\" and because I was the only one who would speak my mind about his bs, however what I failed to realize is how unsafe this man truly was. There was some times where he\\'d walk in on me changing and would just scream at me and obviously I\\'d scream back cause I was terrified and half naked in these incidents, this also led to panic attacks.\\n\\nA particular incident that sticks out to me is one where my own mom went behind my back and told this man something I asked her in confidence (it was about a sleepover with my girlfriend,  this guy is homophobic and transphobic, he was basically against anyone who wasn\\'t a white cis male), he came in my room after my brother woke me and screamed at me and wouldn\\'t stop, I remember clutching to my blanket as to not reveal my toplessness and crying as this guy screamed at me in my safe space and then a panic attack arose, he walked off, got ready for work and shit talked me to my little brother, my brother also heard me having said panic attack from downstairs, unsure of what to do, he gave me a cake when I got downstairs, and my phone so I could call my gf (he\\'s an awesome brother and was only a kid so did what he could) \\nThis was during in of the lockdowns in the UK btw\\n\\nI screamed at my mom once, telling her how much I hated this man and how badly I wanted it to end even if that meant ending myself and she did nothing, she stared at me, eyes and mouth wide open, she didn\\'t utter a word to me, I ran crying, thinking about how badly I just wanted to be gone from this world, and tbh if it wasn\\'t for my siblings, girlfriend and friends I probably wouldn\\'t be writing this rn.\\n\\nThen I turned 16, I was finally old enough to have a choice on which parent had custody over me, I was very hesitant at first cause of my little brother and I didn\\'t wanna leave him there, but one weekend, my little brother was at my dad\\'s, I stayed at my mom\\'s (I was sick of smth) and my \"step-dad\" threatened to starve me and screamed at me till I cried.\\n\\nSo I ran upstairs, called my dad while crying hysterically, through broken words I told him what happened, he had enough of the treatment I was getting and cause I was now 16 he told me to just pack my bags and my older sister would come get me and not to worry about the custody of my little brother as my dad wasn\\'t gonna let him go back to my mums.\\n\\nso that\\'s what I did, I packed mine and my brother\\'s clothes, I also packed sentimental things out of fear they would get broken if I left them, and I ran out the house without being noticed, got to my sister\\'s car and left, the only evidence I had left was a message from my dad to my mom saying \"You didn\\'t even notice your own daughter left the house\" or something along those lines. And it was over, my mom didn\\'t even try to fight for custody, she\\'s now paying my dad child support and probably living a horrid life with that man, she told me she\\'s trying to leave him subtly, not sure I believe that tho.\\n\\nHonestly I\\'m 1000% happier living with my dad, he\\'s so understanding with my mental health and has gone to the ends of the earth to accommodate me and my brother, and I honestly recommend that if you can leave a shitty situation just do it, yeah Ive had to make a lot of sacrifices and I see my friends a lot less but I\\'m finally happy, I haven\\'t had a panic attack in a very long time. I can finally walk around my own home without feeling like I\\'m walking on eggshells, I can wear what I want without worrying that I\\'m being stared at, and I can finally have my body the way I want it without criticism, it\\'s so lovely now and I\\'m slowly improving my mental health it\\'ll never be perfect I understand that but it\\'ll be better then it ever has :)',\n",

       "  'Title': 'My life is stale **Trigger Warning**',\n",
       "  'Text': \"- **Trigger Warning** -  **SH, ED and abuse** -\\n\\nHi all, new here. I'm 30 and finding life hard to cope with. I feel so lonely and dull. I'm also pretty sure I have something undiagnosed but I don't know where to start in getting assessed or whether there's even any point because of waiting lists etc.\\n\\nI'm going through what appears to be a cycle of initially starting a new job and feeling excited, enthusiastic, extraverted and almost hyperactive and then the honeymoon period fades away and I don't want to engage with the world and I see the job for what it really is and I return to introversion. I was always creative and artistic and never did anything with it and I think it's screwed my life up. Because now I have to earn money to pay off debt accumulated from doing a degree I also despised and had nothing to do with my passions. I keep entering into 'sensible' job positions and doing 'sensible degrees' but they drain the crap out of me and my soul just dies. Really I dream of doing anything creative or literally just being a cleaner so that I don't have paperwork and people to deal with. I wanted to act, create, sing, paint. I came from a small village in a small country and those things weren't sensible to pursue where I was from.\\n\\nSo here I am in a sales position. I hate competitive jobs and this job is a lot more competitive and sales oriented than I had interpreted. Then I come home to my partner who hardly spends time with me which I've become used to and I actually don't mind as I enjoy my solitude and my me time. We have no sex life at all, well an average 'bang' of once a month. We live with his aunt and he's uncomfortable with having sex with her in the house or in the next room which is completely understandable. He says this is his reason, however we had the house to ourselves for 2 weeks when she went on holiday with her girlfriends and he barely touched me. He got high with his friends every night instead. I'm partly to blame because I don't initiate but I don't know how to anymore and I've lost my confidence. I've done what I can in other ways such as cater to his kinks but there's zero heat between us. It's weird, I had the opposite problem with my ex. He wouldn't leave me alone, I would have to really quickly get dressed out of the shower in a panic because I would hear him come up the stairs ready to touch me. I had obligatory sex with him almost everyday, sometimes more than once and he began to repulse me as a person. Life is so ironic sometimes. I think I find it hard initiating sex with my current partner because I don't want to be anything like my ex was to me so I go by energy or signals before even verbally approaching but there's never energy or signals. I don't want to be a monster or a predator. \\n\\nI love my current partner to death but it feels like living with a sibling. All we do when we are together is talk about what to eat and what to watch on TV. There's no depth to our conversations, he doesn't reply to most of what I say because he's distracted by his phone. We have very different love languages. I'm more physical and verbal where as he is more expressive in gestures like lending me money as a student when I was almost needing to go to the food bank. I was once a very sexual person and now that's gone. I used to feel attractive. I'm struggling to come to terms that I have no passion in life, in my job or my relationship. I'm constantly tired because I'm depressed but I have no one to talk to about it. I feel so alone.\\n\\nI have vivid dreams and nightmares most nights that make me feel drained in the day. I'm on antidepressants which haven't helped that. I've always had whacky dreams so I'm stuck with that I suppose. I still have dreams about my abusive ex who I broke up with 5 years ago (relationship of nearly 7 years) but he still haunts me. He appears in my dreams, moving back in with me and trying to have sex with me and I'm having to break up with him all over again and I feel disgusted in the morning.\\n\\nI can't decide who I am. I can't decide who I want to be. And before I know it, life will be over and I'll have never known who I was.\\n\\nI'm not healthy, in fact a heavy smoker who looks frail in the face these days. I had blood tests done last week and I honestly hope it's bad news.\\n\\nI've been so close to relapsing with my ED and my SH which no one knows anything about. People knew I was struggling with food but not how much I was not eating and how much I was exercising.\\n\\nIs this life? Wake up, work and fake a smile all day, eat and sleep? \\n\\nI daydream about living off grid, being in nature and making my own home safe away from everything else. I feel I have no place in this world. I look at the ducks and I'm confused why I'm a human and not a duck. I honestly get so frustrated at times that I was born and had no say in it.\\n\\nI'm not suicidal, I feel an obligation to be here. I just feel like my existence is just waiting out death.\\n\\nThe thought of going into work and pretending to be happy or even okay is filling me with dread. On one hand I want to blend with people and appear normal and on the other I just want to cut the BS, get angry and cry in someone's arms.\\n\\nSorry for the rant, I just really needed to offload.\",\n",

       "  'Text': \"Sorry if this is all over the place, but it's been a rough 24 hours. My boyfriend (21) reached a breaking point where he felt overwhelmed and finally accepted he needed more in depth help. He admitted himself to an inpatient facility within a hospital Thursday afternoon at about 5pm with his mom and I present to take him. He had initially requested intensive outpatient care but he felt overwhelmed and said he jumped at the first thing presented to him which is the inpatient care he is in now. In the 24 hours he has been there he has started to feel as though this was not what he needed and overall feels confused as to the purpose of the facility and frankly neglected as he doesn't feel like he is receiving the care he fully needs. I'm not sure if this is a national or state by state guideline, but he signed a voluntary commitment form stating he will stay there for a full 72 hours and after that he needs to give 72 hours notice of wanting to leave. My question is at what point is he able to put in his request to leave? Is he allowed to put in the notice say Saturday at noon so that he could be discharged Tuesday at noon or is he not allowed to request this until his initial 72 stay is over? He has a meeting with the main doctor sometime Monday morning and wants to talk to her about moving to intensive outpatient as he feels it better fits his situation, but doesn't want to be stuck there for an extra 3 days after the meeting.\\n\\nTo try and help understand where both he and his loved ones are coming from, here is some of his history and the experiences with the facility so far. My boyfriend has never harmed himself or others at any point in his life. He has occasional suicidal thoughts, but has never made any attempt at pursuing them. He has been on medication for depression and anxiety about 5 years now has been regularly seeing one psychiatrist for at least the past 3 years - the hospital contacted her to confirm his active prescriptions and working with her. His major stressors were work and full-time college which he is now putting on a big pause, work being the main of the two. He felt that intensive outpatient was what he needed as he could have the comfort of his home, family, and friends around while still receiving about 8 hours of care a day and eventually figuring out long term adjustments to therapy and medications. However, now that he is in inpatient he has replaced the stress of work and school with being in an unfamiliar situation where they do not allow him to use any devices other than a publicly monitored wall phone and he is not allowed to receive any visitors due to Covid (none of the staff are wearing masks, face masks, or gloves and he hasn't seen a single person sanitize the place yet - it seems like a lazy excuse to him). His mother is looking at intensive outpatient programs who would be willing to take him in hopes that it may speed up the discharge process and show the doctor, along with his history, that he is committed to getting treatment. Basically if anyone has any experience or advice of how to help him through this it would be so greatly appreciated.\",\n",

       "  'Text': \"My mental wellbeing has always been somewhat of a rocky road. Growing up, I was always the quiet child who got good enough grades and never took part in anything, and was praised for being 'well behaved'. From since I can remember, I have never really felt content with myself and my life, expressing this as unbeknownst sadness and loneliness in childhood, and as hyper self-analysis, depression, OCD, and possibly more, now that I am self aware. All of these issues are undiagnosed, and have never been accepted as genuine by the majority of people in my life, having grown up in a family that considers mental health to be a thing that you need to sort out by yourself - though it was never explicitly told to me, this effectively taught me that the way to feel better is to internalise and eventually you'll figure it all out.\\n\\nI held this belief when I was 11 and had just developed my first OCD compulsion, checking my school bag had the right class books over and over again for *hours*, **right in front of my family,** and I've held it since - though now it less of a belief and more of a nasty habit. \\n\\nI internalise everything. All of my mental issues, yes, but also my passions, my day to day feelings, passing thoughts - things you'd normally share with others and get off your chest. I've consistently felt embarrassed, even disgusted by myself. (Self acceptance? I don't know her.)\\n\\nSocial situations have always seemed foreign to me, people's emotions never seemed to make sense, the crazy social rules and norms that make you feel instantly rejected if you say a singular thing out of line. It's never made sense to me. It felt isolating to always be alone with my thoughts, thinking that I'm barely passable as a human being. Is it normal to feel like you're not human?, like nothing is real?, like *you're* not real??\\n\\nReality has always been a bit of a less than solid concept to me. No clue if that's normal, but that's not really the point.\\n\\nI've isolated myself so much mentally and socially that it feels like I'm the only person who even *has* problems. Obviously, that's false, I know it is. But my irrationality takes the evidence of my experiences and decides that I'm a special case, 'yeah, other people have problems too, but, *you,* you're *especially* wrong'. Not only is this isolating, it's embarrassingly arrogant - and only makes me detest myself even more. (Fun little unbreakable cycle :).)\\n\\nWell, anyway, I've realised I actually haven't spoken about uni much, I hope you don't feel misled by the title. This is all relevant, since these are all things that have led into the culmination of eighteen year old me, a fresh uni student, and already suicidal and resorting back to the self harm that I vowed to myself I wouldn't repeat two years ago.\\n\\nYikes, I thought college was bad? Boy, if only I knew how it would it hit me like a iron to the face (a la home alone) when I strolled into university expecting greatness, only to be left with my already crippling loneliness tripling in size, and my depression coming back in full swing. \\n\\nIt's just not a very yummy or amazing time in my life. I don't know what aim I had in writing this. I guess I just want people to know without feeling any pressure, in my own terms.  Isn't it crazy that I can say all of this shit on reddit and not to my friends?  Whenever I talk about my problems I feel like a hinderance. I mean, I was just feeling suicidal and yet didn't tell anyone because it would just inconvenience them?? \\n\\nI'm also such a horrendous people pleaser and I hate it. Instead of having my own thoughts or opinions in the rare case that I'm in a social setting, I'll basically dissociate the whole time and just passively agree with everything. I know that this is boring from an outside perspective, yet I can't seem to stop. Maybe that's the next thing I need to work on. Either way, I feel like this makes me look stupid to others, which is frustrating because I know in actuality that I'm passionate, opiniated and interested in discussion - it's just that my irrational fear of rejection completely overrides this.\\n\\nIf you read all of this, thank you, it's nice to know that I managed to connect to someone on this planet  (without an ounce of guilt!!). \\n\\nTL;DR:  Uni fucking sucks, especially when you've felt lonely your entire life and have no idea how to interact with people. I feel like I've been robbed of the freedom to have a personality... by myself??? I know, it doesn't make any sense :,).\",\n",

I’ve had a lot of more minor things going on (moving in with gf, dealing with parental relationships, looking for a job, getting settled In apartment, getting robbed lol), but more significantly, overshadowing all of that, my dad had a stroke. Luckily he survived and is in recovery, however it has taken up large chunks of my time, which obviously was not anticipated.\\n\\nWith all of this happening, I’ve felt extremely overwhelmed, and am constantly busying myself to distract myself from my emotions.

I graduated college in May and have since left almost all of my friends. I no longer am apart of the extracurriculars that gave me so much joy. I’m living with my girlfriend, and all of her friends live in the area, and they have been extremely welcoming to me. However, I have really, really missed my old friends, the ones I’ve known for longer than a month and knew me as me, not as someone else’s partner. And after the stroke, I’ve felt as though I haven’t had time to really process that grief. It’s nice to have people here in any sense, but I feel sad, more than I have in a long time, and I want to finally confront it.\\n\\nI feel like I want to fix this and don’t know how. Logically I know it won’t be immediate, but I guess I just wanted advice on what to do.

Cousin just died, another even closer cousin probably has terminal liver cancer and still drinking, and I can’t even tell my mom what happened last week because idk if she still has the strength to hear it at 70.\\n\\nWould be nice to have a therapist to discuss things with and maybe point me in the right direction.\\n\\n\\nI have been calling the hospitals, hotlines, and  centers in the city around me \\n(NYC) for months trying to find help or someone to talk to….\\n\\nand they either don’t take my insurance or are out of business or simply don’t pick up the phone/ return any messages that you leave…….some have even picked up the phone and immediately hung up because I am assuming that the phone is ringing off the hook because a lot of people are suffering right now and trying like me.\\n\\nEven after the incident, the psychiatrist inside the hospital that saved my life told my gf she would ensure me an appt because she told her about my searching for help.\\n\\nI called and the psychiatric center inside the hospital said they needed an official referral because my mangled wrist isn’t going to cut it!\\n\\n…so today I get one from the plastic surgeon that is trying to save my hand from surgery.\\n\\nCalled the clinic with the referral thinking finally I’m going to at least get an appt to get screened and hopefully some help.\\n\\nOnly to be told that now the medical director has to review the referral and will either approve or deny my appt in a couple weeks.\\n\\nHow can life possibly find a way in this bs “healthcare system”?!\\n\\nI plan to invest my time to prevent people like me reaching dangerous levels of “fuck it all” but I need to get help myself first and it’s criminal how bad mental health is being underserved across the world, not just in my country.\\n\\nAny advice or suggestions are appreciated and thank you for reading this far.',\n",

This problem seems to be creeping up on me in the last few years, though, where I feel like I've been shorter with people and far less inspired to do nice things for people or expend energy to help the people around me. I'm being less careful with what I say to people and feel less worried about whether or not what I say or do makes someone feel bad. I'm really worried because I don't want to devolve into an inconsiderate person that makes others feel bad, but it feels like I have so much less patience and emotional energy than I had at one point in my life.

       "  'Text': 'As a person with mental illness I understand just how easy it is to get caught up with your own stuff. It’s not something you can just “get over”. But If you are going through things to the point you are unable to think of others, you get easily defensive, disregard others boundaries for your own and are consistently unreliable, do NOT make friends. You will be toxic to everybody you meet. Whether you mean to or not. When I was in my darkest place, I was uninterested in making friends or establishing close relationships and I made that pretty clear until I got the help I needed. I have been on the receiving end of the behavior of people who decided to still make friends despite not being able to handle doing so. Its hurtful to be ghosted by people you think you connected well with. To have your every plan you were excited about for days be crushed by their flakiness. your kindness being taken advantage of at every corner. Those are terrible things to do to someone. Mental illness or not. Your feelings are not the only ones that matter. And if you are in a state where you are unable to grasp that you need to let people know you are an emotionally unavailable person and be direct. if you are aware of how “not there” you are for people you say you care about and never apologize or feel bad about it, I question if you’d be a good person in the first place. Having mental illness does not excuse toxic behavior and it does not make you an automatic angel. I have a lot of patience for people who are trying their best yet are struggling and are honest about it, and take responsibility for their actions. I do not have any patience for those with zero care about how they may have hurt someone. Even in my worst pit of depression I could never “not care” if I was hurting another person. I just don’t understand that logic. I would at least apologize and mean it.',\n",

       "  'Text': \"Yeah long story short, I was always shy socially reserved and generally awkward as a child, teen and now adult. It's weird because I'm now 27 and I expected this issue to be resolved by now but I've made progress! So incoming wall of text about my situation and what I've done to progress. Also location is the US.\\n\\n\\nAnyways, like I said, ever since I was in high school, I developed this weird habit of always spending to much time in my head imagining myself interacting with classmates around me, we would make jokes and I would laugh in real life. I didn't realize how weird this was until later in life, but I would do that stuff. I would rarely talk and everyone knew me as the quite one. During HS I only had few friends but they were obnoxious and would treat me badly, but at least I wasn't alone. \\n\\n\\nI always found it weird that at that time I also thought that people had the same issue as me. I thought that they were all shy and reserved and that they didn't spend time with people, that they didn't interact with other in school. I thought that until I got Facebook. It weird but seeing  pictures of my classmates with friends and family just enjoying life, I thought that was weird, I thought everyone lived life like me. That's when I realized that I was weird and perhaps I wasn't normal.\\n\\n\\nCollege came around at the age of 18, and that's where my 'isolation' period began. I pretty much didn't interact with a person at all other than my parents, sister and cat. I would go days without saying a single word and just let these weird 'imaginations' of me talking to my classmates consume me. I thought I was social but I wasn't. It was just me speaking to myself and making weird imagination scenarios. \\n\\n\\nI vaguely remember when I was 21 or 22 that i went to turn in some library card and I had some girl look at me weird with this freaked out face and I realized that she was doing it to me. Why? Because I was apparently laughing at some stupid scenario. I then decided to no longer do that or to control myself. \\n\\n\\nI also developed a habit of checking up on a HS crush of mine, just to see how she was doing. Weirdly enough, I no longer liked her. I just developed a habit to see what she was dong. For the most part she had her socials private so I wasn't sure what she was doing.\\n\\n\\nThe harder I think about what I did at age 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, I realized that I've done nothing but the following: \\nJust jerk off to porn excessively, take 1 or 2 classes in college (I transfered to a university at 22 I think?), try to find a job, try to focus on computer programming, try to study. spend time on the internet.\\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to school, i did poorly. Sometimes I would struggle to get things going, to actually study or motivate myself to learn. Yet despite this I graduated in 2021 with a CS Degree. How that happen, I don't know. I never did anything meaningful in college other than go to class, and try to pass. I rarley interacted with anyone. If you were to ask any student about me, they probably don't even knew I existed. As for the professors, I'm pretty sure they knew me but saw me as the 'weird' student or 'quite' student. I really hate that stigma...\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the beginning of this year, I pretty much tried to get my shit together. I was a recent college grad, with 0 employment history, and 0 social/networking circle. I needed to get my shit together. And so I somehow got a job by lying about my job history. It was a retail store. For the most part it was easy, just fold clothes. But I again had issues with interacting with my coworkers. They all saw me as weirdo and would always ask why I was quite or never spoke to them. \\n\\n\\nDuring this time, I started smoking weed. I only smoke weed 1 or 2 times during high school but never got truly 'high'. That all changed with consuming edibles and weed. I want to say that by doing weed, it helped me out a lot. Like it's honestly weird how it help me see my life for what it truly was. That I was wasting it. That I was a loser for just stalking a random girl that I had no feelings anymore and just watching small glimps of her accomplishments that shes done over the years, about my excessive porn use, and how I was 27 and I haven't don't nothing. Anyways, after my high trip, I felt ashamed of my behavior with my coworkers, they probably saw me as a weirdo. So I ended up quitting. And for the first time I started feeling depressed. Like genuine sadness. I kinda felt numb with this feeling for the most of my life. I remember that feeling was super strong in high school and up to 21 or 22 years old. After than the sad feeling went away. I just got used to it and I didn't feel much other than intense anxiety when someone spoke to me.\\n\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, suicide was on my mind ever since I was 15 or 16, but never went through with it. Long story short, recently I found out that someone I went to college with actually did this. It's weird, that persons life was in my eye 'perfect'. We were in the same major but she did really well, got good internships at Amazon, had a large social circle but that didn't matter. She ended up taking her life. It's weird. Anyways, I was curious and probed around but found some details as to why she did it. She also had mental health issues and she went off the deep end, committed a crime and was facing serious jail time. I feel like that she decided to escape by ending it. \\n\\n\\nAnyways, like I mentioned. I truly, TRULY, did waste 10 years of my life by just not being social. My weed trip helped clarify what I was doing in my life, and what I need to do to correct it. I used to be ashamed and scared to even use my voice but recently I decided to just join random chat groups on Wakie. I went from being shaky and nervous to calm and some what shaky. I still have anxiety but I don't want to let it control me. I also want to start therapy. I feel like it will help a lot with what ever is going on with me. I sometimes think I may be autistic or have aspergers, idk. I just want to enjoy my life before I die.\\n\\n\\nTLDR: I'm weird with issues.\",\n",

I'm just not sure how to communicate that I feel distant and resentment but I don't hate her. And it's just caused me to have a block and I just don't feel the desire to talk to her or my dad. Idk to me it seems confusing and I'm not sure what to reply back yet.\",\n",

I work in retail, and I am pretty shy and dislike people, but I manage, everyone at all my jobs liked me as an employee, but I never stayed. Usually, after a meltdown or emotional outburst outside of work due to life stressors is typically the reason I walk out of my job. Death in the family, suicidal/homicidal thoughts or outbursts, a significant breakup, or relationship issues. Stuff like that. Somehow I've just started therapy even though I barely make enough to survive. I don't want to quit my current job at the mall, but I have been calling off often just due to my depression and inability to finish my online classes with 13 weeks left.\\nI have a doctor's note from my therapist for tomorrow, but im worried I might get fired. I'm just too depressed to care. I can at least keep my therapist if I lose my job?  Hopefully I won't  but my hours have been cut from 18 to just 5 or 10. So idk what to do if im fired. I just hate having a mental illness. My mom got mad at me and said that depressed people at her job can manage a fulltime job and not threaten suicide or cut themselves in front of people. I wish she could understand that depression isn't the same for everyone. Idk im going to relax cuz im stressed typing this out. If they fire me ill, I have to look for another job. I'm only 23, but this has been my 7th job. I feel guilty for not even keeping a job for even a year.\\n\\nSorry for the horrible grammar.\",\n",

He’s been diagnosed with DID in the past and was medicated for a while for that.\\n\\nRecently, around April, we ended up in the hospital because he felt so afraid he was going to do something to end his own life. The doctors gave us some numbers and we went from there. He’s been put a few new meds and they referred us to a psychiatrist which we are still waiting for.\\n\\nI’ve been trying to find him a counsellor but each one I suggest is either to expensive or he’s not really up for it which is fine. I’ve chased up with the psychiatrist as well and turns out he missed a few calls from them so I had to get him put back on the waiting list. \\n\\nIt’s been 6 months since he started getting worse and neither of us can see an end to this. Every time he seems a bit better he’ll randomly tell me he’s feeling really tired and having suicidal thoughts again.\\n\\nI just don’t know what to do any more. I’m trying to be there for him but it’s becoming really painful. I don’t feel like i’m ever helping him even though i am really trying my best. \\n\\nI guess i’m looking for advice here. We keep having the same conversations about him needing help and as much as i’ll come back with options he never seems to follow it through.

       "  'Text': 'I don\\'t know if this is the right place or not. But I really need some help trying to understand. For starters the person I am going to talk about refuses to see a therapist or to go on meds, for many reasons a few which are valid and a few which to me are not. This person has above average intelligence or they use to. This person is male and 46.\\n\\nThey have always struggled making friends and keeping friends but are desperate for friends. It is a major blow to this person that they don\\'t have friends.\\n\\nAs much as this person does good deeds I feel there is a lack of understanding when others have issues, or that they do good deeds to feel they have done good deeds and that makes them a good person. \\n\\nWhen I see them interact in public I get very anxious and sometimes embarrassed. Someone might ask about their mother and it ends up with fifteen minutes of complaints about how their dad was never around as a kid (as an example). But what I see is almost every action pushes people away instead of closer which is what they want. It has literally destroyed their self esteem that they don\\'t have friends and that most people \"are users\".\\n\\nThis person has difficulties with almost every other person they are around for any decent amount of time. They say they constantly feel like everyone else misunderstands them and that it is everyone else, and it always has been everyone else. This worries me because it is now making it difficult for this person to see doctors and other professionals. They say they are feeling judged by the doctors, the last two doctors this person has been too have been uncomfortable with this person. They said this person seemed angry and I would not doubt it comes across that way as long lists of complaints and agitation/anxiety would be present.\\n\\nI have tried to help this person as they seem completely unaware of what people see when they interact with them. I am literally one of the only people who still deal with this person. If I say anything that is even slightly like they are doing something wrong it is a disaster. I have tried every way I can think of. Problem is I feel like this is self sabotage and is only hurting them more and more.\\n\\nI know there is anxiety and I feel there is depression as well. But the complaining, seems endless. I don\\'t know how to deal with that, the negativity is also pretty bad. Any talk of any mental issue is taken as a massive insult even though this person knows they have anxiety and \"depression\" though they don\\'t admit to clinical depression, only depression because everything is terrible.\\n\\nI am pretty much the only person who has stayed around long term.\\n\\nDoes anyone please have any ideas of what this might be?',\n",

( i got kids) that one packet of valium lasted me over 2 years, and i ended up throwing half of them away because i just preferred not to use them.\\n\\nMy doctor flat out refused to prescribe me any and tried to put me on anti depressants instead insisting on it being better even though i am not prepared to commit to ANY medication long term and would certainly discontinue using not to mention the long list of side effects id play russian roulette with.\\n\\nAll while my family is being displaced... forced to move... not because we are bad tenants but because we had a terrible landlord that sold this property after letting it degrade for 4+ years while we paid out rent during this time and 2+ years of being kept in the dark from the REA, on period leases, right up until 3 days ago.. the property sold and the new owners have given us the minimum amount of the time to vacate the property.\\n\\nIm agoraphobic because of 10+ years of being a street kid, ward of the state and now im being forced to find a new home during a housing crisis and so yeah i have lost my ability to manage my anxiety and im worried im going to induce a heart attack with how often im getting heart palps from chest tremors and im not interested in some long term drug that i know will help me but im just not fucking ready... its that hard for doctors to understand why? please tell me if i am being unreasonable? \\n\\nI walked out of the doctors.. i feel like he doesnt give a shit about me or my family.. why even be a doctor if you arent willing to understand where your patient is coming from and the rational reasons why i wouldnt want to take an unpredictable drug i have zero experience with in the past, would require a thorough review of my conditions to find the best suited plan and drugs needed to improve my mental health.\\n\\nNot just throw me on anti depressants and call it a day.\\n\\nThe dumb ass doctor asked me when was the last time i saw a doctor about my heart and am i on thinners etc... the last doctor i saw was him, years ago i started getting a chest infection and he denied me antibiotics so i went home and asked my missus for some of hers she had for something else and my green flem and chest infection aka early stages of pneumonia went away... surprised pikachoo face.\\n\\nAm i the asshole here? can anyone please advise me on how i can just get some damn tempo relief from this extreme anxiety.. i am not a friggin junkie, i dont even drink, cant stand the taste of beer so there goes that.. im poor as fuck.\\n\\nAdded pressure im currently dealing with.. i gotta hold it all together infront of my son.. hes 7.\\n\\nWe have no car, very little savings, im on DSP which 90% is taken because my partner works... like wtf man i dunno why this doctor wouldnt just listen just this one time when i need it.\\n\\nam i wrong to be upset? what can i do please advise.',\n",

       "  'Text': 'A couple summers back, I became obscenely depressed. Before then, I had always thought there\\'s no way I could actually be suicidal. However, I felt like no one wanted me around them anyway due to some friend group drama and a bad time overall almost every day. I would hop on a game with friends over the summer, and then we would lose every game and I would get off and go to bed, keep in mind at the time this was my life, I really wanted to get into the esports of that game(R6 Siege if anyone is curious) and ended up making it to the top 5% recently, at the time I was 15 and losing really hurt, I knew there was more to life than the game, and I had a life outside the game and nothing was working out in the real world to. My soccer team was falling apart, my family was fighting, my friends were excluding me, and it felt like everything I was around was disintegrating. So after losing a bunch of games with my friends, I\\'d get off and go sulk in bed. I\\'d check up to see what they were up to a few hours later, and they\\'d be on a massive win streak. This happened almost daily and combining with already existing insecurities and mental health problems, I decided I was the problem and started to isolate myself. The part of me that actually still wanted to live hoped that maybe people would notice and reach out, but no one was, not even my own parents. I stopped eating right, barely slept, and barely talked for months, eventually I decided I didn\\'t want to live anymore. Luckily not even the same day where I truly felt suicidal, a friend who I had only known for about a week, barely talked to, and didnt know irl reached out, he told me he noticed I\\'d been a little distant and when I was there he felt like I really wasn\\'t. I\\'d argue he saved my life, and it really hurt that out of all the people to reach out, it was the one that knew me the least and had never met me in person before. Asking for help had never been my strong suit, my sister dealt with the same thing when she was my age and she talked to my parents about it and they shipped her off to a therapy camp, so from a young age i learned quickly not to tell people how I felt (I\\'ve changed now, still cant tell people I know how I feel hence why I\\'m writing this but i know its important). Part of it is not wanting them to know the weaker side of me, considering I\\'m kind of the anchor of the friend group, and the other part is not wanting to be judged. I sent out signs for weeks, i made jokes about killing myself to see their reactions, i pulled away from them, if anyone asked how I was i\\'d say how I was pretty depressed and felt like killing myself, i tweeted out some of my thoughts, and i made it pretty clear i was overwhelmingly depressed. But not a single friend of mine, most of which I\\'ve known for 10 years, reached out or said anything about it. Now me, not wanting to be like them, always reach out even if I\\'m not worried and try and look after all of my friends and make sure that they know I\\'m here if they need me. Around the same time I was suicidal, one of my friends actually told me he really needed someone to talk to and explained to me, he was probably going to take his life, this was terrifying because he was an online friend and there wasn\\'t anything I could do to actually be there with him, so I told everyone in my server what was going on, and we all changed our discord status to \"We love you rob!\", he told me that actually really helped and that really cheered me up. Everyone in the server immediately reached out to him and all made comments in the group chat he\\'s such a great friend and they were super scared about losing him. And it just hurts, like i know its because i didnt reach out but i mean i tried i just cant. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\ntldr; I was suicidal and tried to give my friends signs but they ignored them, yet when another friend who they barely know is suicidal they all jump to make sure hes okay and it really hurts.',\n",

I have had 3 sleep studies where they say I have sleep apnea they address and the nurse commented on how very little REM sleep I get, but the doctors say that’s due to the apnea. However, I finally realized that I have always only had nightmares. I remember some from as far back as 9, and they were always awful. I didn’t mention it to my psychiatrist or therapists because I never processed it as abnormal. They run the range of truly terrifying to very uncomfortable. No common theme(s) that are abnormal. I was raised understanding lucid dreaming and have never been able to do so. This is not common for my family. \\n\\nI’ve now tried a medication used for PTSD nightmares that is a blood pressure medication (can’t remember the name right off) and am now on amatrtaline (not sure I spelled that right), with both, my dreams have not I,proved, but the bad feelings associated with them stay longer. My husband has reported some yelling in my sleep, but nothing else of note.\\n\\nMy concern is last night I woke from a nightmare (I wake about 3-5 times per night) and was getting the dogs out of the bed (still mostly asleep), and became aggravated, thinking a dog was between husband and I and started slapping the ‘dog’ pretty hard. And realized as my poor husband awoke and yelled at me that I was slapping him! Fortunately, we both have excellent senses of humor and have been laughing about it all day, but I’m neither ever physically violent nor easily aggravated, so this behavior is quite odd and I will stop this medication.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I live in a tiny town, so there is only 1 psychiatrist and 1 therapist who does the therapy I need (although this issue has been discussed with her and the therapist before her) and everyone is stumped.

This is after she corrected me in front of a psychiatrist and police officer. \\n\\nShe saw me feeling side effects of lexopro that I was taking and she asked me if I wanted to take a seroquel pill. \\n\\nShe caused me to react in a way that caused me to get committed both times.

I have almost done it a few times, but it was always late at night and I just couldn’t bring myself to cross that line. It wasn’t that late this time, but it was a Friday night. I have to imagine he wasn’t happy to get a text from work on a Friday night, no matter how dedicated he is. I definitely care too much about how he sees me, but for the first time I didn’t let that stop me.\\n\\nI was spiraling. I couldn’t talk on the phone because I was hiding in the bathroom and I didn’t want people to hear me. I had also started to cry and was trying to rein it in so it wouldn’t be so obvious on my face when I walked out. I felt like if we talked it would all spill out so I just texted him asking if we could talk tomorrow.\\n\\nI’ll probably be aware the whole time that I’m bothering someone on their Saturday. And I don’t know what I’m going to say because I’m afraid to talk about what was really going on when I texted him.\\n\\nI have never told him about self harm or suicidal ideation because I don’t want to get thrown in a fucking mental hospital. I know I’m not the only person in this situation, but I don’t know what to do about it. A part of me thinks he doesn’t want to know because it would only shatter the illusion that we are making progress. But maybe I’m not giving him enough credit, and anyway what’s the point of therapy if I’m just trying to convince my therapist I’m getting better? \\n\\nToday I couldn’t keep up the charade. I was in pain and I needed to know he was there. Just knowing we can talk tomorrow lifted a weight and got me through the rest of the night. I have no idea what we are going to talk about. He’s obviously going to want an explanation. I might panic and avoid him. I might tell him everything. I’m scared because our relationship can never go back to how it was before this irregularity. And I probably have to admit some things to myself and him.\\n\\nI don’t know if this was a good idea. I feel like I tried a new drug or something and am starting down a bad path. Or maybe I’m being honest for the first time and taking my first real step towards improvement. I am scared but I might have made the healthiest choice I could at the time.',\n",

It\\'s become progressively worse over the years, no one in my family takes it as seriously as they should, as I\\'m a danger to them as well. They shrugged it off as depression but it only started as that. It\\'s evolved into something so much worse and I\\'m not sure what. I see things, feel strong homocidal urges just from someone speaking to me, I feel disgusted by everything around me, including myself. Some days I feel really happy, then I\\'ll randomly feel terrible and consider ending everything another day. My mind is constantly chaotic or nothing is happening at all. Often it feels like it\\'s own entitity, as if it\\'s seperate from me. It warps my perception of everything for the worse, it\\'s like it\\'s actively working against me, sentient. No one takes me seriously, I\\'m very reserved about how I feel, but I\\'ve opened up a few times to a close family member, they just put it down as depression because that\\'s the easiest mental illness to lable someone as. If someone has an illness more advanced than depression, they don\\'t know how to deal with you and get frustrated, try to push you away. I don\\'t think I even want to be cured or happy, I\\'m so used to feel so isolated and terrible that I\\'d be confused and scared if those feelings went away, it\\'s all I know now. I get intense, compulsive thoughts about absolutely covering my body and face in cuts, burns, scratches and so on. I want to do it until there\\'s no room left and there\\'s scars on top of scars. I\\'ve self harmed before, which family knows about, but STILL it wasn\\'t enough to be taken seriously, so do I really need to maim myself beyond repair just for someone to realise \"This is worse than depression, he needs proper help seriously before he hurts someone\". My mind tells me to give in and hurt others and honestly it feels tempting, as I feel all they\\'ve done is hurt and ignore me, so I want them to feel some of the pain I am constantly in. I snap myself out of it when I get those thoughts. I know it\\'s wrong, that\\'s why I\\'m making those post as I know I need help before things go bad.

He is in no way trying to be mean or tell me how to act. \\n\\n**Doctor addressed**\\n\\nAnxiety \\n\\nOCD tendencies \\n\\n**Brought to my attention**\\n\\nI've(21F) been with my boyfriend(20M) for almost 4 years. He knows me and knows how to read my emotions for the most part. Over the last couple of months, he has noticed a change in my behavior and brought it to my attention because it concerned him. We end up having long conversations about the way I'm acting. He says, he feels I lack major parts of empathy. He says it's always been that way but recently it has gotten worse enough to where he needs to bring it up. I have him explain what exactly he means when he says I have little empathy. He brings up I can’t connect with people on an emotional level, I don’t express my emotions “socially correctly,” and a major part is I can’t read the room or people's emotions. \\n\\n**How I feel**\\n\\nI honestly believe him. I usually feel almost nothing emotionally for people. I lack the “correct” way of expressing myself. I often find myself with a plain face and a monotone voice when I'm just relaxing, mad, sad, or even happy sometimes. I go out of my way to not talk to people because I feel like most conversations are unimportant. I used to purposefully make myself look mean so people would not talk to me but it just turned into the normal for me. I say things without thinking of others' emotions. I tell myself I'm worthless if I don't complete a task like schoolwork or something I believe I can do. I have a “god” complex where I mostly feel like I can do most things and my way of thinking is usually the most efficient. I only cry when I am overwhelmed with frustration. \\n\\n**What I am currently doing or plan on doing**\\n\\nI hate feeling this way so I plan on changing. I will do mostly whatever it takes. I look up videos on how to properly show emotions and body language to match. I’m currently on Wellbutrin for anxiety and feeling exhausted constantly thought my day. I try to connect with people more and not sound so uninterested. I plan on finding a therapist to talk about these feelings or lack of them. \\n\\n**What advice I'm asking**\\n\\nFor the people who've experienced what I'm going through, have you ever gained empathy? Will the feeling of blandness go away? How did you address these feelings? Opinions?\\n\\nFor people who know people that lack emotions, what do you feel they could do to improve their communication skills? How did these people make you feel when you saw or talked to them? \\n\\nAnybody else, please feel free to drop any advice. It’s appreciated. \\n\\nHonestly, any advice or support is appreciated.\",\n",
