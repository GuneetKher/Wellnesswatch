I generally really want to sleep. However, when I’m trying to fall asleep at the very moment, when I’m about to pass out, I suddenly get scared and wake up instantly. as I have observed, this fear comes from anxiety to be unconscious which is super weird for me since I really enjoyed it, be asleep and avoid any kind of thinking these days. So all these things are so contradictory I don’t understand what is going on. I cannot tell, but I’m suffering from particularly strong nightmares, I do have bedrooms, but nothing too scary (since I used to suffer from severe nightmares before and even then I didn’t have any issues with falling asleep). what do you think it might be, I cannot afford to go to the therapist at the moment, and I cannot find much googling either so maybe you can share some of your experience.

            "I don't know what is happening, at first I fainted in school a week ago, it was the scariest experience ever. Everything was fine for a bit then yesterday again in school during a lesson my head started spinning, I got dizzy and after walking around the school for a while I went to the nurses office and later went home. I ate and drank water, slept considerably well. I woke up today and in the morning everything was still fine, but later on in the day I started feeling weak, like I was going to faint, I tried to get blood into my head by tilting it down which made me sick and almost throw up, I got really scared and started shaking, went to lay down in bed and started crying. Now I've been weak the whole day and a few minutes ago I started panicking again because I thought I couldn't breathe I got weak and until now I feel like I'm going to die, my head is spinning, I feel like my airways are constricting and I'm scared I don't know what to do or what is happening, my mother (who is a psychologist, but can't actually diagnose me because she's obviously a family member) said that what is happening to me sounds like a panic attack, does anyone know if this looks like a panic attack? (And yes I will be getting medical attention, blood test, going to the neurologist etc.) This has never happened to me ever before until a week ago. I did have pretty bad sinusitis, I have read somewhere that if your immune system is weak that it messes with your mental health? I'm not exactly sure, because I used to be a rugged person, I could handle stressful and even dangerous situations, now suddenly I'm sheepish and shaking, feeling like I'm on the verge of dying every second. Please, any explanation would be helpful, I am really desperate at this point, because it's horrible.\n",

While, yes, obviously. He expects me to just not feel these emotions. He believes that the bpd symptoms I experience can just be “helped” because of my age, because I’m an adult, because I’m a mom. It’s my “responsibility” to not let those things happen to me. Where do I draw the line between the tough love I obviously do need and getting him to understand it’s just not that easy?

I had kind of picked up on the fact that she most likely has quiet BPD which is different than my ex. I am completely overwhelmed when I’m her sole means of happiness. I don’t live my life like that. I have friends, family, and a life outside of just my relationship. I’m not defined by just the person I’m dating. She has no family, no social life and gets upset if I’m like busy and can’t respond. I’d like to discuss this with her but she gets really defensive. I really don’t know what to do. I also don’t understand why I gravitate to people with BPD .  I’ve mentioned a couple of times, that everyone could use therapy in a non I think you have BPD type of way and that wasn’t well received.

            "Someone on tiktok posted a video which showed a guy in a couple treating his gf like shit, so I replied that not every guy is like that and my bf for example is so kind and I love him sm. Someone replied with \"don't trust men\", wtf do you want, are you invalidating my relationship just because you had bad experience with men? I had too, my two abusers were (unfortunately are) men, but other than these two, my bf saved my life multiple times from 2016 to now, my two male best friends saved me on June and are the best. 99% of the relationships I had with girls, ended up with me being bullied by them and rumors spread about me, 99% (the other 1% are those two...\"humans\")of relationships with males ended up with them disappearing and not causing me trauma.\n",
            "So I feel frustrated because they invalidated my relationship, my past friendships who brought me a period of joy and happiness, a beautiful childhood etc, and are invalidating my current friendship with those two guys, who are still helping me. I'm trying so hard not to insult that person, because they invalidated my relationships with men, just because they had an awful one. \n",
            "They ruined my perception of my bf, now I'm scared to text him because I feel he might become like me old abusers because all men are the same. \n",

            "My bf is currently sleeping so he can't even calm me down, I don't want people to think bad things about the love of my life, the one who saved me multiple times from attempting and the one who is making my life worth living. I hate that person, I hate them so much, I wish them the worst, because no one can insult the person who saved me\n",

So anyways I’ve been partnered up with a friend for the last couple of weeks during these audits, so our supervisor has been very focused on him rather then me I feel like. Yesterday my partner was gone from work due to testing for a certification and I was left alone with my advisor. I completely stumbled it, I completely forgot my papers because this was my first time doing it alone and didn’t realize the papers I needed were missing. So I arrive to the job and I let my supervisor know I left my paperwork at warehouse, he didn’t freak out but you could definitely tell that he was upset. Basically everything after that went wrong and I blanked out completely forgetting everything, he questioned me while I was talking to the customers so he made me second guess myself majorly and I just lost all of my confidence. I cannot figure out how to be confident around him and feel as if I know what I’m doing, whenever I’m around someone who’s better than me at something I feel like I’m not doing anything right\n",

            " Over the past fifteen years, I've seen a lot of shit. I've been in and out of many different kinds of therapies, and through this process I became interested in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. I've been in and out of hospital emergency rooms and psych wards. I've talked to many therapists and endless mental health professionals. I've been bounced around from conversation to conversation. But I've only scratched the surface. This is a lifelong journey.\n",
            "\n",
            "And it can be therapeutic to share, so that's why I am doing this. There aren't a lot of people who come from my background who get to share our stories outside of a closed group therapy setting.  And our stories are important. Our voice is important. If we can share our experience, and someone out there sees that another person is going through this, and that there is some sort of universality to mental health struggle...well, that can do more than any therapist can do for an individual. When we see that lived experience, it can inspire us to keep going as opposed to giving up.\n",
            "\n",
            "So yeah, I have borderline personality disorder, social anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder.  That is why we're here.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, I can't stress this enough: it is crucial for us to not make our DSM diagnoses our identity. Diagnosis is useful for personal and treatment purposes, but one can easily go overboard and make their diagnosis a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, wherein a list of traits becomes ones, for lack of a better term, entire personality. We start to see our psychopathologies everywhere, or in everyone, and we make them the reasons for all of our behavior. I don't believe this to be healthy or useful.\n",
            "\n",
            "I have experienced the fear of a diagnosis, the relief of knowing there is an actual name for what I live with, and also a period of becoming obsessed with my diagnosis. Having lived through those three stages has offered me, what I would like to think, is some perspective, but that's up to whoever comes across this audio to decide. One can only have so much insight without exposing their own blind spots.\n",
            "\n",
            "That said, a diagnosis can help put things into place, and absolutely can help explain some of our behaviors; so let's talk about some of the characteristics, or traits of borderline personality disorder as we answer the question...  \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**What is borderline personality disorder?**\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's go over these traits and how they apply to me personally. But let's also keep in mind that these manifest in different ways for different people, that these are not the only criteria for borderline, and that one doesn't have to experience all of these to qualify for a borderline diagnosis. \n",
            "\n",
            "First**, We can talk about difficulty regulating emotions**.  We feel emotions more intensely than others, and our emotions can rapidly shift without warning. People with BPD tend toward living in constant emotional crisis because of this tendency to feel our emotions with more intensity than others. We're kind of wired to see our surroundings as dangerous. Others may think that what we see as a crisis, is actually to them, not really that bad. \n",
            "\n",
            "That said, we're over here doing impulsive, sometimes even dangerous shit in attempt to make these intense feelings piss off. In crisis, we make poor choices, and in the wake of the crisis, we are left to pick up the pieces and deal with the consequences. Even worse, this makes us feel shame and can send us into a shame spiral, creating a new crisis in the process. So, it becomes more or less a cycle of intense emotion, impulsive behavior, and shame.\n",
            "\n",
            "What can we do to throw a wrench in this cycle? Well, we can stop, essentially drop everything and wait for as long as it takes before we react. This means restraining ourselves from a poorly planned action which can be anything from making a hasty phone call, to sending an urgent text, to stopping ourselves from picking up our preferred substance. \n",
            "\n",
            "Then, we have to take a step back in order to gain some distance from the situation, then we need to observe by doing things like naming the emotion, locating how the emotion is making us feel in the body, note the thoughts that are running through our heads, examine the chain of events without trying to judge them, and what are other people saying about the situation, then we proceed mindfully. \n",
            "\n",
            "We have to create the space between the emotion and the action, we have to observe what the potential consequences can be, and even examine what the reality of the threat is to see if it matches up with the emotion. These are some skills that one can learn through DBT, which stands for dialectical behavioral therapy.\n",

            "Another thing that helps with emotional regulation, and this is a DBT skill they will teach you if you ever get in or have been in one of those programs, it's called opposite action. So basically, when you are feeling an emotion that doesn't line up with the facts of the situation, like you're overreacting sort of, you can shift that emotion by acting the opposite action of the urge you would given the emotion. Does that make sense? \n",

When you're feeling sad, your urge might be to withdraw and isolate, whereas the opposite action would be to do something active. And sure, this is simplified, and it is easier said than done - but when it's practiced as a skill and built up over time, it can become very effective. If you'd like to know more about opposite action, let me know in the comments and I'll talk about it in more detail. Let's keep on with symptoms. \n",

We can quickly fall in love with a person, and just as quickly fall out of love with them. On top of this, we tend to push people closest to us away while also feeling this intense fear of abandonment, even if it isn't real, so we may do weird shit and act out in order to get people to stick around. To boot, I have a tendency of reading neutral cues as negative cues, including facial expressions and body language, and a history of traumatic relationships makes it hard to believe that it simply isn't going to happen again. This is all about attachment trauma, another thing we can talk more about in the future and if you're interested in more details on attachment theory, again, let me know in the comments.\n",

These behaviors are often exacerbated by shame, we are often more likely to act out in order to distract ourselves from the pain of shame. Behavior becomes more and more destructive in attempt to regulate one's painful emotions. It's a maladaptive coping strategy that comes from traumatic experiences more than it is the intentional manipulation people often believe it to be. \n",

The impulsivity of borderline makes this worse, but the awareness of the impulsivity over the years has taught me that this feeling does not, will not, and cannot last forever. A feeling is just a feeling, and that feeling will pass. This is an important lesson for anyone with this condition to learn: nothing is permanent, and things will get better. \n",

I tend toward progressive muscle relaxation meditation because years of a tense nervous system made relaxation feel impossible, but the more you chip at it, the more it works.

This is another thing that I think is somewhat repressed by medications, exercise, and things like mindfulness meditations. Simpler therapies like CBT and things like radical acceptance also help with this, but we will talk more about therapies and skills later on.\n",

I often feel purposeless, directionless, and like there is nothing inside of me but the absolute garbage I shove inside my body. This can feel akin to loneliness, grief, depression, and hopelessness all combined in a neat little package, and this doesn't go away when things are going relatively well, either. It's chronic.\n",

Perhaps this is another trait that medications, meditation, mindfulness, and exercise minimize overtime.

We tend to think in extremes which shift based on if things are going well or not. We have difficulty assessing situations as neutral. We have difficulty finding the grey areas, the nuance. Rather than letting ourselves feel overwhelmed or confused by things like nuance, splitting allows us to feel more comfortable by making us more sure and simpler. For me, this is about control. I can't control outcomes, but I can control how I perceive them, for better or for worse - if that makes any sense. I don't know, splitting is hard to explain. Maybe we can talk more about it in the future.\n",

Needless to say, this fucking sucks, but I deal with it every day and it is one of the more pervasive symptoms I experience. I feel like who I am is constantly changing, and those changes are not easy, they are often painful. I often even feel like I'm not quite a human being, like I'm alien, or incomplete. \n",

One can experience absorption, which is when you get so into an activity that your mind blurs out everything around it. Like, imagine reading a book, and you're so focused that you don't hear the alerts on your phone and you lose track of time. This can be a good thing sometimes. It's only unhealthy when it's used in a maladaptive way.\n",

And I couldn't describe it for the life of me. But it always felt like I could see myself, but I couldn't be myself, and even sometimes put myself in what I felt to be other people's perspective while looking back at me from the outside.

For example, genetics can create a predisposition toward impulsivity and intense emotions, while biology is guiding our brain and body's response to environment and said intense emotions, then the environment can reinforce the intense emotion if it is punishing toward the individual, thus, in a way, rewarding maladaptive behaviors and building them into what become symptoms. The more we act a certain way, the more it is reinforced. Neurons that fire together, wire together, and so on.\n",

            "\n",
            "I remember sitting on the edge of the playground at lunch and staring ahead blankly, occasionally looking sad, and desperately waiting for someone to come ask what was wrong, just so I could respond with, \"oh nothing\", as if they should have known, or maybe they would think I was being stoic. And this worked sometimes. Like, I would also just lie my ass off to get people to like me. I would like the things they would like, even though I have my own taste, I am a very malleable person. \n",
            "\n",
            "One thing that really stands out for me though, is I started this thing where I would always tell people I was leaving. Like, as if my family was set to pack up and move on. Eventually we did, but I'm talking years in advance. Like, this is the last summer you'll have the chance to see me before I'm gone forever type of shit. And this was clearly to get this kind of attention I felt that I deserved. It would only get worse from there. I would act out in these ways more and more the older I got.  \n",

            "Well. it wasn't a linear path to say the least. I knew something was up ever since I can remember. I grew up being, for the most part, terrified of other people unless I was very familiar with them. This doesn't mean I was anti-social. I loved making people laugh and having a good time, but I had trouble assessing what/who was a threat to me from a very early age. I know that my disposition was shy before I experienced abuse, which I won't go into here, we can save that for another time, but it was far worse after the experience. This began at the age of four. \n",
            "\n",
            "I spent the next fifteen years on edge, exhausted, distracted, unsure of myself, unsure of others, with difficulty sustaining and establishing interpersonal relationships. I began to use drugs at a very early age, and it wasn't until my addiction was unwillingly revealed to my parents at the age of 19 that I was taken to see a doctor. \n",
            "\n",
            "This doctor decided to put me on even more pills than I had already been taking, specifically that of Ativan and Paxil. The former felt like heaven on earth at first, before it became just as, if not more addictive than what I had already been taking. The latter resulted in suicidal ideation, weight gain, and an overall flat feeling throughout the duration of taking it. There was no therapy, no formal diagnoses other than the one individual doctor saying, oh, you probably have anxiety and depression.\n",
            "\n",
            "And don't get me wrong. I did. I have a ton of stories as to how depression and anxiety manifested in my life. Like not being able to leave the house, not being able to get out of bed, and the lengths that depression and anxiety would go to control my every action at the time.\n",
            "\n",
            " These things still happen, but I am more aware of when they do. I try to give myself the time and space to feel them when they begin to affect me to this level, but I try to allocate a set amount of time to feel them. Like, literally. I will set a timer or an alarm on my phone and say to anxiety or depression, \"okay, you bastard, this is how long I am allowing myself to wallow in self-pity, or this is the amount of time I will ruminate on this subject before moving on to another thing,\" and it doesn't always work, but it gets easier with practice over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anyway, back to these early years of dealing with my mental health. Needless to say, things got worse. The initial period of medication adjustment and upping in doses made suicidal thoughts ramp up. Combined with this, I was drinking a lot. Soon thereafter, there was a thinly veiled suicide attempt, which was more of a cry for help than anything else. After this, I came off the medication. \n",
            "\n",
            "Looking back, I definitely experienced mania at this time. High energy period, rapid weight loss, increased risky behavior, poor decision-making, and I began to sever existing ties whilst starting new, unhealthy relationships. This was followed by a period of debilitating depression and anxiety. The kind where I couldn't get out of bed for days at a time but would eventually come out of it and experience the cycle of mania again. \n",
            "\n",
            "This went off and on for many years, and basically just began to feel normal to me. It took years to become mindful of the cycle, even if it was obvious to those around me. Hell, it's hard to say if anyone was really around me enough or for long enough to really pin these behaviors down. Anyway, in my late 20s I got out of an unhealthy relationship, got sober, and began a particularly unhealthy relationship. I fell deeply in love with someone who already had a partner, and although I was on board intellectually with being their second partner, things weren't there on an emotional level. Especially with having borderline. \n",
            "\n",
            "At the end of this, even before the end of it, I acted out so strongly that my behavior scared others and myself. I went to the hospital several times during this period, saw many different mental health professionals, and was finally diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. I was in my late 20's at the time. \n",

            "\n",
            "Borderline personality disorder affects my ability to create new relationships, but also causes issues with keeping existing interpersonal relationships with friends, family, co-workers, and even casual acquaintances. This leaves me with a very scant social circle and very weak social life. I tend to recall social interactions more negatively than positively, recalling the negative aspects and remembering situations that may have been totally neutral as negative. I remember this being a huge problem as a teenager. Not matter what I would do, or where I would go when I went out, I would remember every single stupid thing I said or did, and I would ruminate on them for hours afterward, even if I had a good time overall.\n",
            "\n",
            "My unstable sense of self causes difficulties with working, as it makes me near unable to tell if I am doing a good job or a bad job. I am in need of constant reassurance and no matter how much I receive it's never enough. No matter what, I feel like I am constantly shitting the bed, even if I am working my ass off, which I usually am. This leads to debilitating anxiety both in and outside of the workplace when I am employed. It makes it difficult to come to work, difficult to not take things personally, but also leads to consistent discomfort when I am outside of the workplace, always thinking and worrying about it.\n",
            "\n",
            "My behavior online also sucks, like I used to post pretty frequently on social media in attempts to get attention, and when my symptoms are strong, I still do this. But I regret my posts, and tend to delete them, and I block a lot of people on a whim or just cut contact with them. I delete accounts, abandon accounts, or just have several accounts on any given platform at any given time. I feel very empty about my social media experience, yet I somehow feel it is important to my existence when though I have basically no social media presence anymore. It is as if it is integral to having a personality somehow, even though I know, at the core, it doesn't fucking matter at all.\n",
            "\n",
            "Recurrent thoughts of suicide, a persistent empty feeling, and damaging impulsivity cause issues with planning future decisions, often leading to inappropriate, impulsive ones that end up being poor choices that damage my overall life. This has also led me to frequent trips to the emergency room, which anyone will tell you isn't a fun experience. There is nothing like wanting to kill yourself, sitting in a waiting room for hours, then having to sleep with all your clothes on in a cot in a busy emergency room hallway only to talk to a psychiatrist for two minutes and have your meds adjusted before being sent on your way.\n",
            "\n",
            "It sucks for my creativity, too. I am, at the core, a creative person. I always want to make art, I am always writing or editing something. I never learned to draw or paint, but I am always being creative. Yet every time I make and share something, especially online, my unstable sense of self and impulsivity act up. I end up deleting any trace I can out of embarrassment, or the things I end up posting are impulsive in their own right. Either they are in no way ready to be shared, or they are far too personal to be shared in the first place. Boundaries here, are a huge issue.  \n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "When things are really bad, for a long period of time, well, let's talk about mania, paranoid delusions, psychosis? Yes. I have experienced them all, and they are not fun. Mania can FEEL fun when it is going on, but it is scary for those around you, and your poor decisions when one is manic have pretty fucking gnarly consequences. When things got really rough, and I decided to come off my meds, I felt like I was being watched and like I was being sent cryptic messages through online spaces. This got really scary for me. \n",
            "\n",
            "I just thank God that I went to the hospital after a while of feeling this way. A lot of people get to this stage and end up never questioning if they've lost touch with reality or not, never reassessing their actions and thoughts. And I did. I'm proud of that, and if you are going through that, there is no shame in this. It's okay to question yourself, to ask your thoughts if they are trying to fuck with your head or not, and to go speak with someone, be it at the hospital, or with someone close to you. No matter how far you go down the rabbit hole, you can come back out and reach the surface of reality again.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anyway, like I said previously, borderline isn't all that I am, and it isn't all that anyone else is, either. People with BPD have their own stories to share, be they about overcoming trauma, or other life experiences, they have careers, academic experiences, travel experiences, and a lot of us have tons of experience reinventing ourselves. We tend to be a lot of different people over our lives, and we can look at the world from all of these different perspectives if given the chance. We are complex people, but we tend to isolate ourselves from others because of the shame and guilt we feel. Some of the most interesting people I have ever met are diagnosed with borderline, and my life would have not been the same without them.   \n",

            "\n",
            "It's also important to note for those living with BPD: you can, and many people often do, get better. It doesn't happen overnight, and it's a hard journey for sure, but recovery is real. People recover every day. \n",
            "\n",
            "So, with all that, I wonder if people have had any misconceptions about borderline that have been cleared up. I know, before I was first diagnosed, and for some time after, a lot of people thought the borderline was another term for having multiple personalities, which couldn't be further from the truth. I think that, in years sense, that misconception has largely faded, but also that borderline has been labelled as a dangerous pathology, that people with it are dangerous, prone to be more abusive and violent that others, which is another misconception. We are all capable of violence and abuse. \n",
            "\n",
            "Most psychopathologies arise from an origin of trauma, and I believe that most abuse from traumatized peoples is not intentional manipulation or violence, but more of an unhealthy coping mechanism that was established in youth. Some may disagree with me here, and that's fine, but I know that I can personally trace abuse back early to my life and can pick out when traits of borderline began to appear. Sure, hindsight is 20/20. but sometimes I look back to social interactions or thoughts I had in my early youth and think \"oh, shit, that was borderline.\"\n",

Well I decided yesterday to go through these four huge photo albums that I’ve been carrying around for years. Wow. It was almost all pictures from those two years. I pulled out a tiny few that I wanted to keep and just threw away the rest. It feels like a weight lifted. Not only had I been carrying around these things emotionally but I’ve actually been physically carrying them from house to house with me. So here’s my PSA to all of you- go through your stuff !!!

            "I was diagnosed with ADD and Anxiety early on in high school (I am currently a junior in college for context). Since then, I've tried loads of different medications to attempt resolving my symptoms, including SSRIs, anxiety meds, and ADD meds. After trying all sorts of medications throughout high school, it became evident that anxiety/depression meds only worsened my symptoms/condition. Eventually, I went on Adderall my senior junior-senior year of high school and it worked perfectly. Besides the occasional bad comedown I would get from the medication, I was performing excellently in school and never experienced any brain fog or ADD symptoms while taking it. However, after my senior year of high school I stopped taking Adderall as it became less accessible for me during the initial COVID years. Fast forward to my junior year of college (present-day)- I decided to go back to my psychiatrist and be put back on adderall as my ADD symptoms only worsened to the point where I would have large gaps of time in my memory that I don't remember (due to my brain always forcibly going on \"autopilot\") and worsened performance through college. I thought going back on the medication would help- however, no matter how low or high of dosages I have tried, medication treatment only worsens my ADD symptoms and made me develop a sort of depression and worsened anxiety. For example, I began taking 10mg XR and 5 MG IR per day, and have adjusted the two dosages many times to the point I am currently taking 20 mg XR and 15 mg IR per day. Throughout this school year, I have found that taking my medication, no matter the dosage, not only makes me zone out/dissociate/go on autopilot at an increased rate, but it also made me develop symptoms of mild depression. I don't only feel these symptoms on the comedown anymore, but constantly feel riddled with depression and severe anxiety about completing tasks, being motivated, school, etc. It has gotten to the point where I feel like a hopeless case, because I know that depression/anxiety and now ADD medication not only doesn't help me, but it worsens my symptoms to a severe degree. I have tried reading everywhere what I could possibly do to cope, but it seems like medication is the only way to treat my condition, given its a neurological disorder- but if medication is making my symptoms so much worse, what can I do? Im not asking for medical advice in any way, but would just like to see if others have experienced the same issue/what they found helped them. I've read a few other threads where people ask for more details because every case is the same so here's some more- I get between 8-10 hours of sleep every night, eat three meals a day (ive heard what you eat contributes to the efficacy of adderall) containing lots of protein and carbs, and I also have myself on a simple routine. please let me know why might my ADD symptoms be worsening despite medication and therapy, my anxiety has genuinely gotten to a debilitating stage that makes it extremely difficult to complete any daily tasks (homework, working out, confronting problems) and I just want to be better.\n",

I believe I was 11 when I started being more intentional. By the time I was in high school, I traveled from hidden areas to more visual areas. In all my time, I never got caught unless I showed (save for one incident). When I was 19, I had to stop due to pregnancy. But a part of me never wanted to stop. So every few months or so, I have small relapses to mostly ground myself. I'm 23 now, 2 kids, an ok job, and newly single. I can't tell if it's just a wave of the past month and a half catching up to me, the holidays, or just that time, but this relapse feels different. Worse almost. I find joy when I'm burned at work. I don't intend to, until it happens. But I stole a box cutter and fully intend on my more hidden areas.  It's been about... 4 or 5 months since my last. Wish me luck, wish me good and fast healing. And I hope to God that no one follows in my footsteps.\n",

            "I think back to this experience I had once. This older woman I work with looked at me once and asked me how I was doing. She asked if she could look at my eyes, and I agreed. She got within an inch of my face and it felt like she was looking into my soul. She said it looked like I was in pain or really sad. I kinda panicked knowing her next question, which was why? I put it on some minor annoyances in my life because in truth, I wouldn't even know where to begin, and if people know, they look at you like you're dangerous or something. How do you explain the mental effects of seeing people die, having someone you loved get abducted, raped, and poisoned multiple times only to turn on you several times attacking you in your sleep, getting targeted and shot at or stalked, set up to be stabbed in the face, having to fear for the lives of your family, having to do things that nobody would ever want to just to save the life of myself or others while the authorities do nothing, and of course the feelings that come with failing to protect your loved ones. \n",
            "Like tbh I get these feelings of wanting to commit the big S (I won't so don't worry) because I feel like I'll never be normal again. The only people I get along with are people as traumatized as I am. I feel like I can't even connect with my family and friends anymore. Can't even go on a date with a girl because even trying not to have \"sad eyes\" or looking around for threats is exhausting. Not to mention trying to ignore all the mental flashbacks and random fight or flight or anxiety attack triggers. Tbh I don't even feel like I can trust mostly anyone. The people I can trust I'm so terrified to even express what I'm feeling because I don't want to be seen as like a monster or like I'm tainted. The only people who understand me are people who were out there in the mix of things too. I mean even recently I saw my mom nearly get killed in a freak misunderstanding, and then almost make a mistake that would have gotten someone else killed while in a concussed and angry state of mind. I can't even speak about that. There is so much I just have to keep inside and I just want it to end. I just wanna be normal! Literally only some months back I had to deal with people a few towns over spreading rumors I was in \"the Mafia,\" my ex lying about me to make her setting me up to die look better, and distant family attempting to \"help\" their \"drug kingpin\" relative by getting me wasted, lying to a hospital and getting me locked in an isolation cell and force fed pills that made me suicidal for a non-existent drug addiction and suicidality. Had I not known what the pills were doing, I would have let that emotional state consume me. 2 days it took for a psychiatrist to actually see me and read my chart, and I'll never forget the confused expression and him saying \"it says you're here for suicidal thoughts and drug addition. You didn't seem to have any drugs in your system, and you don't strike me as suicidal... Why are you here?\" and then after explaining, him saying \"okay, I'll get you out of here as soon as possible. Hang tight.\"\n",
